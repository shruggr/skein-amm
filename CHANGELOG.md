# Changelog

Released versions of skein-amm. 0.10.0 is the first entry here; the notes
on earlier versions are below as the README carried them at 0.9.1, in the
names of their time, and each release commit names what changed.

## 0.51.0 (2026-11-11)

On skein-overlay v0.28.0, skein-1color v0.20.0, skein-sdk v0.22.0 (the signer client); the token image
on skein-chain v0.12.0, each by tag.

- amm-validator: a swap is ONE step (David 2026-11-11, plans/one-step-swap-settled-2026-11-11.md rules 5-7):
  `proveRequest`, then every input checked unspent in this instance's view before signing (the pool's:
  `pool_spent` with the newest state; any other: `submit_refused`, the overlay's `InputSpent: …` text), the
  signature, the pool input's script run on the finished transaction (failing: `bad_transaction`, nothing
  recorded), the signed BEEF handed to the overlay's in-VM `intake` in the same step (ingested, broadcast,
  admitted), and the frame answered with the signed transaction and the overlay's verdict. Requests for one
  pool are processed one at a time in arrival order; a later one finds the pool spent.
- Gone: the pool locks (src/lock.zig, the head `amm/locks` — a record an earlier version wrote is not read),
  `Reason.pending`, `{wait: true}`, the handler called again (`reply` / `resolved`), the submission by message
  (`submit.box`, `submit.body`) from the signing path, `Next`.
- The intake call names this app (`{app, beef, topics}`): the engine resolves its configuration by it (the
  validator runs in the front door's request thread, which names no app).
- 0.51.0 everywhere (etc/app.json, build.zig.zon, amm-lookup metadata, @dcasegr/amm-engine, amm-client).
- Release notes: a FRESH HOME is required (skein-overlay 0.28.0's: a 0.27.x engine's submission threads
  resting on `chain/tx/<txid>` end in error on their next wake, and transactions admitted before have no
  `chainTx` subscription); an old `amm/locks` record is left unread.

## 0.50.1 (2026-11-11)

On skein-overlay v0.27.1, skein-1color v0.19.1, skein-sdk v0.21.3 (the signer client); the token image
on skein-chain v0.11.1, each by tag.

- amm-validator: the request's scripts and signatures are checked once, before the lock (D6,
  `requestProblem`). Step 8's second, signature-only check (`inputsSigned`, `completeParents`) goes;
  step 8 reads the unproven parents only. The reasons `missing_signature` and `bad_signature` go (a
  bad or missing signature is `bad_transaction`, `ScriptFailed: …`), and `unlock.checkInput`.
- skein-sdk 0.21.3: a transaction this instance holds, carried raw in a request's BEEF, is not
  script-checked again.
- 0.50.1 everywhere (etc/app.json, build.zig.zon, amm-lookup metadata, @dcasegr/amm-engine, amm-client).

## 0.50.0 (branch `release-0.50`; not tagged)

On skein-overlay v0.27.0, skein-1color v0.19.0, skein-sdk v0.21.2 (the signer client); the token image
on skein-chain v0.11.0, skein-signer v0.1.1, skein-wallet v0.1.1; for skein kernel 0.8.0 (a step sees
its own events; events placed by the instance-wide step number).

- amm-lookup on the 0.27.0 lookup contract: its events are its own — raised with `svc.emit`, read
  with `svc.events` / `svc.latest`, its names under `svc.app`; nothing handed back to the engine.
- A Swap admitted in the SAME overlay step as its pool's deploy (one BEEF carrying both) is
  recognised: each hook reads the facts it needs by name, and a step sees its own events. On 0.49.0
  the Swap's hop was lost for good (no hop, no fees filed, the pool gone from `ls_amm`) — reproduced
  as a test before the change.
- The Close is read, not re-derived: `spent` finds the spender's next hop (`amm/output/<spender>.0`,
  raised by `admitted` earlier in the step).
- The answers read spent-ness from the chain (`chain/output/<txid>.<vout>` latest `spent`): a pool
  output a transaction the topic never admitted spent is not live (`{tokenId}`), and is `closed` in
  `{poolIds}`; rolled back, it is live again.
- The pool lookup's token and validator counters are gone (nothing read them since 0.49.0); the
  pool's counters and the token fee tally stay.
- amm-validator: a transaction's status is the chain state's (a proof overrides a rejection): a swap
  rejected then mined is answered mined; the engine's earlier `rejected` answer no longer wins over the
  state as it stands.
- Clients: no change from three-part event ids (`<s>.<i>.<thread>`): no client code parses an event's
  place or id; `next` / `after` cursors are opaque.

## 0.49.0 (release candidate, branch `release-0.49`; not tagged)

The pool lookup as a RECOGNIZER (agent-env plans/research/plan-pass-recognizers-2026-11-09.md; David
2026-11-09 "INDEXES vs SUMMARIES", point 8 "fees at admission", "TOKEN TALLY", "COMMISSION KEY PER
SWAP", "RESCIND"). On skein-overlay v0.26.0, skein-sdk v0.19.0 (through it), the token image on
skein-chain v0.10.0. skein-1color v0.18.0 (the color lookup on events). skein-sdk v0.20.0 for the signer client and the named call. Joined with the client branch `client-0.49` (Withdraw removed; the commission key per swap). Needs the kernel's named call and approvals (skein branch `call-permissions`), the signer app and the wallet app installed with approvals.

- amm-lookup keeps no index. Its maps `pools`, `spentPools`, `history`, `closes`, `trades` and
  `byCommission` are gone. It emits what it recognizes. `<app>/pool/<poolId>`: one row per hop, deploy |
  swap | close | rescind, plus a revert row. `<app>/output/<txid>.<vout>`: the hop row of the pool output
  it lists, or `{reverted: true}`. `<app>/hop`: every row again, in the instance's order.
  `<app>/commission/<txid>.<vout>`: the history flag, written only when the commission is ours. A row
  gains `tokenId`, `keyId` and, on a Swap, `feeVouts`. The row's kind is the field `type` (deploy | swap |
  close | rescind | revert; the commission flag's `commission`): an emitted record's `kind` and `app`
  are the kernel's to set, and a record carrying either is refused (skein scheduler.zig). The client's
  `PoolEvent.type` / `PoolRevert.type` follow (were `kind`). Every field is text or a number; `at` is in ms.
  Earlier facts are read back from the kernel's event index in the step: the pool a Swap spends, a
  re-admission, our fees, what a rejection unwinds. The Close is re-derived from the spending
  transaction, because a step does not see its own emits. It stores only summaries: the counters, and the
  token fee tally (`counters` under `f ‖ tp`, `{kind: "amm-fee-tally", units}`).
- The fees that are ours, recognized at a Swap's admission. The validator fee is ours when the spent
  pool names this instance; its invoice is `[1, "amm pool"]`, keyed by the spent pool's `keyId`,
  counterparty anyone. The commission is ours when it pays `[1, "amm commission"]`, keyed by the pool
  outpoint the Swap spends. Each is FILED through `fileWithWallet`, in basket `bsv` or `tokens`.
  `fileWithWallet` is a seam: today it only records the call, and it cannot fail. Once the real call is wired in, a refused filing fails the hook's step (F3, David: a broken install, not a case to handle). Token fees go into the
  tally, which a spend or a rejection adjusts. A second spender of a coin, such as a proven winner, does
  not subtract it again. A rejection re-credits only the coins in `givenBack`.
- `/lookup ls_amm_<id>`: `{tokenId}` and `{tokenId, poolIds}` keep their answers. `{tokenId, outpoint}`,
  `{tokenId, validatorIdentityKey}`, `{validatorIdentityKeys}` and `{commissionPkhs}` are gone (no reader).
- amm-p2p: `/fees/validator` and `/fees/commission` are gone (no reader). `/trades`, `/candles`, `/stats`,
  `/pools/at` and `/pools/history` are gone from the instance: the Open Exchange host answers them as
  folds over the pool events. `/fees/tokens` is new: `{tokenId, units}`, the tally. The commission key is
  per swap (src/pool.zig `commissionKey` / `commissionPkh`; the client's vector is pinned). `/terms`
  `market` answers `{identityKey, minCommissionBps}`, and amm.swap.terms answers `{identityKey,
  minCommissionBps}`. The key ID `relay` and `commissionPkh` are gone.
- amm-validator: the wallet-funded Rescind is gone (rescind.zig, launch.zig, root's `rescind`); any other
  message in box `validator` is refused `unknown-fn`. The contract keeps Rescind, and the lookup still
  handles a rescinded pool. Step 3 ("still live") also reads the chain level: a held spender that the
  chain state has not rejected answers `pool_spent`. A resubmission while pending is answered from the
  state, since the pending record names no thread. Settlement is read before pending.
- amm-setup: the seed is the door's envelope, and the engine submits it. The fallback submit is gone.
- Every key and signature goes through the signer app (skein-sdk `signer.requestAs`, under `signer.nameFor`'s name); the raw `wallet` import is not used. The fee filing is the wallet app's `file` by the named call under the basket; a refusal fails the hook (F3). etc/app.json `calls`: signer [`1/amm pool`, `2/skein instance/self`, `2/metanet handles envelope/anyone`], wallet [`bsv`, `tokens`]; no `services`.
- etc/app.json: `lookupVersion`, the `reindex` role and route, the libp2p receive row, `rescind` and the
  dropped reads are gone; `feeTokens` is new.

## 0.48.1 (2026-11-07)

Reindex (agent-env plans/reindex-2026-11-07.md, D5).

- `etc/app.json`: `lookupVersion: 1` — the version of the token app's lookups' record shape (amm-lookup's
  and color-lookup's: 0.48.0's is 1), raised by a release that changes it; the open-exchange host reindexes
  a token instance's lookups after an install whose `lookupVersion` is greater than the installed one. The
  route `{address: "reindex", handler: "overlay.reindex"}` and `reindex` under `roles.root`: root's `{fn:
  "reindex", args: {service}}` in the box `amm/reindex` (skein-overlay 0.23.0) derives `ls_amm_<assetId>`'s or
  `ls_color_<assetId>`'s index again from `tm_color_<assetId>`'s admitted history in place.
- amm-lookup's hooks verified re-runnable into a fresh index: they write only through their `Service`, read
  no head and carry nothing between calls but the maps (a new test: the fixtures' history re-run into the
  empty index through fn `reindex` begin / switch gives the live index byte for byte). The one input from
  outside is the step's time (`now`): a re-run stamps the reindex step's time on the trade and history rows
  (and their keys), not the admission's.
- Pins: skein-overlay v0.23.0, skein-1color v0.17.2. `bin/amm-lookup.wasm` and `bin/color-lookup.wasm`
  rebuilt on the 0.23.0 lookup contract; `bin/amm-validator.wasm` and `bin/amm-p2p.wasm` rebuilt (they compile
  the engine's sources, which now read the head `<app>/reindex`); `bin/amm-setup.wasm` the same bytes.
- Versions: etc/app.json, amm-setup's version test, README, @dcasegr/amm-engine and @dcasegr/amm-client 0.48.1.

## 0.48.0 (2026-11-07)

The data model, second batch (agent-env plans/data-model-cleanup-2026-11-07.md, D1–D5, D9).

- D1: ONE record per pool hop. `pools` and `spentPools` link the hop's EVENT record (a deploy's, a Swap's,
  a rescind's: the `history` row); the separate pool record (`kind: amm-pool`, `validatorPubKey`,
  `admittedAt`) is gone (a rescinded hop is its event's kind). One renderer, `poolRowFields`, for the pool
  row of the live list, the positions' `current`, `/pools/at`, the history and the events; the live list and
  `current` add `lifetime` (their key order and an `at` field change).
  An index written before 0.48.0 holds pool records under `pools` / `spentPools`; 0.48.0 does not read them
  (no fallback): an instance upgraded in place answers its pool reads with errors until it is re-indexed.
- D2: maps `fees`, `byPool`, `byValidator`, `rescinded` gone. `{poolIds}` sums a pool's `history` Swap rows and
  takes its live hop from its last `history` row; `{validatorIdentityKeys}` reads the token's listed hops
  (`pools`, `spentPools`); `{validatorIdentityKey}` filters the live pools; `/trades?txid=` is the Swap's
  continuation record. The answers are the same. `byCommission` stays (see the release notes:
  `commissionOutputs` not built).
- D4: the instance's `/stats` answers `tokenId, lastTradePrice, volume24hSats, volume24hTokens, buys24h,
  sells24h, lastTradeAt, volumeSats, volumeTokens, trades`; `tvlSats`, `tvlTokens`, `pools`, `change1h`,
  `change24h` are the host's.
- D5: the lookup's beat body (`beatValue`, the `beat` map, the full scan per hook, `Spec.beat`) is gone.
- D9 (client): customInstructions — `amm-pools` and `openex fees` `{protocolID, keyID, counterparty, poolId}`;
  `amm-swap` token rows `{protocolID, keyID, counterparty, order?}`; sats rows unchanged. Readers take the
  token from the output's script (`poolRowTokenId`), the symbol and decimals from the overlay; rows filed before
  still read. The output descriptions keep their key ids (see the release notes). `poolCustomInstructions` and
  `swapInstructions` take only the key fields (an API change of @dcasegr/amm-client).
- Pins: skein-overlay v0.22.0, skein-1color v0.17.1. `bin/amm-validator.wasm` the same bytes as 0.47.0.
- Versions: etc/app.json, amm-setup's version test, README, @dcasegr/amm-engine and @dcasegr/amm-client 0.48.0.

## 0.47.0 (2026-11-07)

Read-path optimizations and admission counters (agent-env plans/read-optimizations-2026-11-07.md D1–D6).

- D1: `/pools/beef` is REMOVED (route, filter `poolsBeef`, reads.zig `currentPools` / `poolsBeefJson`, the
  client's `readPoolsBeef`, its tests). A Swap leg reads the chosen pool's transaction with `GET
  /@<token>/amm/tx?id=<txid of the listed outpoint>` (the self-contained BEEF); a leg is now the list read, `/tx`
  and the POST. Rebalance reads the position's spender (`/spends`, spent → `stale_pool`) then `/tx`. The
  client's `poolOutputOf(beefBytes, outpoint)` takes the `/tx` bytes.
- D2: `/spends?outpoint=` is ONE lookup per outpoint, `{outpoint, spentBy?}`: the pool-following
  (`current`, `hops`, `closed`, a transaction parse per hop) is gone; following a pool is `/pools/history`. The
  client's `Spend` type likewise. The BRC-24 `{tokenId, outpoint}` query is unchanged.
- D3: `/trades` steps the trade index BACKWARD from the window's end (skein-sdk 0.15.0 `Map.rangeBack`) and
  reads `limit` rows (one pool's: its `history` in pages of 32 until `limit` Swaps and their time's ties); the
  same rows, order and cursor as 0.46 (a test against 0.40.0's full-window read, 400 random queries).
- D5: amm-lookup `counters` (records, written at each admitted Swap, unwound at its rejection, a dupe counted
  once, no backfill): per pool `amm-pool-counters` (satsIn, satsOut, tokensIn, tokensOut, lpSats, lpTokens,
  validatorSats, validatorTokens, commissionSats, commissionTokens, lastTradeAt — recomputed from `history`
  when its Swap is unwound), exposed on the pool row as `lifetime` (`/pools`, positions' `current`, BRC-24
  answers); per token `amm-token-counters` (volumeSats, volumeTokens, trades), exposed on `/stats` as
  `volumeSats`, `volumeTokens`, `trades` (the client's `TokenStats` too); per validator `amm-validator-counters`
  (swaps, feeSats, feeTokens), not on a read (`/fees/validator` already answers the same sums from the rows).
- Pins: skein-overlay v0.21.1 (skein-sdk 0.15.0), skein-1color v0.17.0 (its counters and `burn` event).
  `bin/amm-lookup.wasm` dbd07a5d…, `bin/amm-p2p.wasm` 71fa531f…, `bin/color-lookup.wasm` 4f924298… (v0.17.0's);
  `bin/amm-validator.wasm` 824750cd… — the SAME bytes as 0.46.3; amm-setup, color-topic, overlay the same bytes.
- Versions: etc/app.json, amm-setup's version test, README, @dcasegr/amm-engine and @dcasegr/amm-client 0.47.0.
  zig 118, vitest 300, engine 68; harness (real toolbox): balance 11, held 1 (five swaps on one pool).

## 0.46.3 (2026-11-07)

Pins only: skein-overlay v0.21.0 and skein-1color v0.16.2 (skein-sdk 0.14.0 through them). A BEEF
out — the chain state's `beefOf`, the engine's `beefOfMany`, the sync's per-block BUMP — carries one
BUMP per block, selected from the chain's tree nodes in one descent (`merkle.pathsFor`), no
`MerklePath.combine` (it rebuilt and sorted every level per merge; K ancestors in one block cost
O(K²) and worse, and reads died "fuel exhausted" near 800 KB). No code of this repo changed.

- `bin/overlay.wasm` = v0.21.0's (sha256 4616849f…), `bin/color-lookup.wasm` = v0.16.2's
  (b2645466…); `bin/amm-lookup.wasm` (7348e2be…), `bin/amm-p2p.wasm` (35464cf5…) and
  `bin/amm-validator.wasm` (824750cd…) rebuilt on the new SDK; `amm-setup.wasm` and
  `color-topic.wasm` the same bytes.
- Versions: etc/app.json, amm-setup's version test, README table and pins, @dcasegr/amm-engine and
  @dcasegr/amm-client 0.46.3 (the client on the engine 0.46.3). zig 117, vitest 300, engine 68.

## 0.46.2 (2026-11-07)

- amm-validator proves a swap request's BEEF before it takes the pool's lock and before it signs (D6). It runs skein-sdk's
  `spv.verify` (the verifier skein 0.3.3's door runs) with the chain state's headers and the held set (in `txs`, not
  rejected) over every transaction but the swap. Then it checks the swap's inputs: each source is in the BEEF or held,
  and every script verifies except the pool input's empty slot. On failure the answer is `bad_transaction`, with the
  verifier's error name, its meaning, and the txid or input (`UnknownTxidOnly: … (<txid>)`). Nothing is signed, no lock
  is taken, and no queue is joined (a waiter that is refused leaves its queue). This holds even while the pool is locked.
- What changes as a result: a raw request whose funding is not held is refused `MissingInput` before signing. An
  unsigned or badly signed funding is refused `bad_transaction ScriptFailed`, because the verifier runs before the
  per-input check.
- Not changed: a door refusal of the validator's own submission still does not resolve the frame thread (D7, a note
  in main.zig). The page's txid rule is 0.45.0's.
- bin/amm-validator.wasm CHANGED (sha256 e99ef111c215022f…); the other programs are 0.46.1's. `@dcasegr/amm-engine`
  and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.46.2.

## 0.46.1 (2026-11-07)

- The page build typechecks. `syncPool` names the cursor it compares, and the openex fees close test uses `LP_KEY_PROTOCOL`. The programs are 0.46.0's. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.46.1.

## 0.46.0 (2026-11-07)

- The LP wallet catches up from the pool output it holds, one internalize per hop. The cursor is that
  outpoint (`listOutputs` of `amm-pools`). `GET /pools/history?outpoint=` starts strictly after that
  record; the client does not read `next`. A hop files output 0 into `amm-pools` (tag `amm-pool`, the
  held instructions plus the pool id) and, on a swap with an LP fee, output 2 into basket `openex fees`
  with the key stored on the pool output. A hop that does not spend the held output stops. Output 0 that
  is not a pool stops. A rescind files output 0 and no fee. A transaction that cannot be read stops
  without throwing. Deploy events are not internalized.
- Close runs that walk, then spends the output the wallet holds. The BEEF is `GET /tx?id=` of that row,
  parents first. The page passes the pool id. The derived public key must equal the pool's LP key, for a
  BRC-29 key or an `[1, "openex fees"]` key. Rebalance stays a close and a deploy: the new pool's key is
  `[1, "openex fees"]`, counterparty self, key id 16 random bytes base64 with no prefix, filed with
  `amm-pool-deploy`. An old pool keeps its BRC-29 key.
- Collect runs the same walk for every held pool, then spends the whole `openex fees` basket. Satoshis go
  to one BRC-29 address. Each token's sum goes to one `p color` output. The pool stays open. Fees already
  in the basket stay there until collect.
- The pages' manifest adds protocol `[1, "openex fees"]` (counterparty self) and basket `openex fees`.
- amm-lookup: a rescinded output is stored by its outpoint in `pools`. The record keeps the validator key
  (33 zero bytes means rescinded; the identity key stays). `swaps` on that output is the next count, and
  the history key uses that number. A live read and the beat skip a zero key. A position read reports
  rescinded from that key. The LP's Close of that output writes a close. `/pools/history?outpoint=` loads
  the record and starts strictly after its `(admittedAt, swaps)`. Unknown outpoint is 404. `from` / `to` /
  `pool` / `limit` / `after` stay.
- bin/amm-lookup.wasm CHANGED (sha256 49b39f1e4a954922…). bin/amm-p2p.wasm CHANGED (sha256 0d517d85dff20819…).
  amm-validator.wasm and amm-setup.wasm unchanged. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.46.0 (unchanged in behaviour).

## 0.45.0 (2026-11-07)

- A swap's BEEFs reference by txid what the token's topic admitted (David 2026-11-07; needs skein 0.3.3's door: a
  txid-only entry for a transaction the instance holds). Pages (`fundingBeef`, `topicAdmitted`): the funding BEEF
  carries the staged inputs' sources raw with their ancestry back to proven, except a transaction the topic admitted
  (the pool's — from the pools list —, any transaction carrying a pool output of this token: a swap the page took in),
  which is a txid-only entry with no ancestry; the pool's transaction is added by txid. amm-validator: `submissionBeef`
  = the request's BEEF, the signed swap its subject, every transaction the topic admitted (`InTopic`: the overlay's
  applied record) by txid, the pool's added, nothing else the subject does not reach; no `beefFor` merge. The
  accepted answer's `beef` is that bundle; a `pool_spent` refusal's `beef` is `newestBeef` (the newest transaction raw,
  what the topic admitted by txid, the rest raw back to proven). Rescind (`withPool`) unchanged. bin/amm-validator.wasm
  CHANGED (sha256 646c5bf0…); the other programs unchanged. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.45.0 (unchanged in behaviour).

## 0.44.4 (2026-11-07)

- The pages' overlay pass (`resolveFromOverlay`) also tries the spent `amm-swap` row's own outpoint as the order key,
  after the row's `order` and before the transaction's own key input. A row written by `stage` carries no `order`, and a
  mined swap served as subject + BUMP has no input sources, so `ownKeyInputOf` named nothing and a swap's FIRST leg was
  reported stuck ("the spending transaction names no order key"); on a first leg the staged row IS the key input
  (`legDerivation`). A wrong candidate costs nothing (`legTakeInOf` answers null). Nothing else in the pass changed.
  bin/amm-p2p.wasm and amm-validator.wasm unchanged. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.44.4 (unchanged in behaviour).

## 0.44.3 (2026-11-07)

- amm-p2p `/tx?id=<txid>`: 0.44.2's route change REVERTED. The route serves what 0.44.1 served (`beefFor`: a mined
  transaction with its BUMP, an unmined one with its ancestry). bin/amm-p2p.wasm and amm-validator.wasm are byte-identical
  to 0.44.1.
- Kept from 0.44.2: the pages' overlay pass reports the rows it could not take in (`resolveFromOverlay` → `{taken, stuck}`,
  the `stuck` progress, `SwapResult.stuck`, listed on the Swap page).
- `@dcasegr/amm-client` on `@1sat/actions` 0.1.5 (exact), which brings the color module 0.2.2
  (`@bsv/color-permission-module` = `npm:@bopen-io/color-permission-module@0.2.2`); the client's peer stays `^0.1.0`.
  The pages' tree pins the same alias (dependency + override) so one copy, 0.2.2, resolves. `@1sat/connect` /
  `@1sat/react` stay 0.1.2. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.44.3 (unchanged in behaviour).

## 0.44.2 (2026-11-07)

- amm-p2p `/tx?id=<txid>` serves the transaction as an Atomic BEEF with EVERY input's source transaction in it, mined or
  not (`reads.txBeef`: the chain state's `beefOfMany` over the sources — a mined source with its BUMP, an unmined one
  with its ancestry back to proven ones — then the transaction itself without a BUMP: an Atomic BEEF cannot carry a
  proven subject's sources, the SDK's reader rejects them as unrelated data). Before, a mined transaction came with its BUMP alone, and the
  color module refused it at internalize (BRC-207, "input N lacks its source"). 404 when the chain lacks an input's
  source. amm-validator unchanged (its wasm is byte-identical to 0.44.1).
- The pages' overlay pass no longer swallows a failed take-in: `resolveFromOverlay` answers `{taken, stuck}`; `executeSwap`
  reports each stuck row (`{outpoint, spentBy, error}`) as a `stuck` progress and in `SwapResult.stuck`. No retry, no
  state: the next pass tries again.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.44.2 (the engine unchanged in behaviour; the client on the engine 0.44.2).

## 0.44.1 (2026-11-06)

- amm-p2p: the catch-up pass is gone, whole (David Case): the cron-ticked `amm-p2p-tick` job `catchup` — a pull of
  proofs by block from configured peers with its own reply deadline, a placeholder from before the overlay sync that
  nothing scheduled — with its tick, its config (`config.amm.ammP2p` / `defaults.ammP2p`), its cursor under
  `amm/p2p`, the provider bodies it sent and its tests. The serving side of proofs by block (`proofsByBlock`) stays.
  amm-p2p now steps only on messages in its box. amm-validator unchanged.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.44.1 (no code change; the client on the engine 0.44.1).

## 0.44.0 (2026-11-06)

The host is the relay (agent-env plans/host-relay-build-2026-11-06.md; David Case: "the instance logs FACTS, never
ATTEMPTS"). A swap being forwarded is an attempt: nothing of it is logged on the taker's side any more; the only entry
there is the overlay submission of the transaction the validator returned.

- amm-p2p: the relay is gone — relay.zig (the pair check, the swap records and the app state's `swaps` map, the relay
  thread's dial / frame / deadline steps, the local relay to this instance's own validator, `expires`), the functions
  `amm.swap.submit` and `amm.swap.status` (and their manifest declarations), the read `/swaps` (P10) and its filter,
  the `/call` route's wait on a relay. What stays: `amm.swap.terms`, `amm.pool.terms`, `amm.pool.affirm` (in-VM, at
  once), the market record, the reads, the proofs-by-block call and the catch-up pass (src/interface.zig,
  src/stream.zig). The commission rule the open-exchange host now applies is in programs/amm-p2p/README.md "The
  commission rule". amm-validator unchanged (`zig build bin` leaves bin/amm-validator.wasm byte-identical).
- Pages / client: a leg is ONE plain `POST <origin>/@<tokenId>/amm/swap` (the open-exchange host's route, 0.17.0)
  answered with the validator's reply (`{ok: true, tx, txid}` / `{ok: false, reason, pool?}`) or the host's
  `{ok: false, reason: "unreachable", detail}`; the page's patience `LEG_PATIENCE_MS` (15 s, an AbortController on
  the plain fetch) is the only timer and closes the request, which stops the host. Gone: `SWAP_TTL_MS`, the leg's
  `expires`, the swap record and its `pending` / `timeout` statuses, `readSwap`. The no-answer path is unchanged.
- Engine: a leg result with no answer is `"unknown"` (was `"timeout"`).
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.44.0 (the client on the engine 0.44.0).

## 0.43.0 (2026-11-06)

One swap in flight per pool (agent-env plans/pool-lock-build-2026-11-06.md D3, D4; on ovh two swaps on one NANNER
pool were signed seconds apart, both submitted before the chain app held either, both held, neither applied).

- amm-validator: when it signs a swap and submits it, the pool is LOCKED in that step (src/lock.zig, the head
  `<app>/locks`: the pool output spent, the txid, the signing step's thread, the request's hash, a queue). A request
  for a locked pool — any output of its lineage — is not refused and not signed: it waits on the holder's thread
  (`{wait: true}`), in arrival order. The holder's step that takes its submission's answer releases the lock (a holder
  whose thread rests without one, the local relay's deadline, holds nothing). Each waiter then runs the same check:
  the first admitted → `pool_spent` with the new state (and its BEEF), as before; rejected → the first waiter is signed
  and takes the lock. Per pool; the same request sent again is answered as before. The local relay and a remote
  relay's frame wait the same way.
- Client: `executeSwap` — a `pool_spent` refusal whose pool the server's fresh list still shows at the outpoint the
  leg spent excludes that pool for the rest of the swap; a changed list reprices as before.
- Pins: skein-overlay v0.20.5 (one held spender per coin at intake; a submission that applies nothing answered
  `rejected`), skein-1color v0.16.1 (on it; 0.16.0's token list search).
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.43.0 (the client on the engine 0.43.0).

## 0.42.3 (2026-11-06)

- `enableTokenPaid`'s payment is a PROTECTED noSend (BRC-177): `labels: ["p nosend expiry seconds 600"]`
  (`ENABLE_PAYMENT_EXPIRY_LABEL`) with `options: {noSend: true, randomizeOutputs: false}`, as `@1sat/actions`'
  payment to a handle. The wallet prefunds an exact anchor (a funding transaction it broadcasts), stores the payment
  in its storage with no change and arms a reclaim. 0.42.2's plain noSend lived only in the toolbox's client-side
  batch: when the exchange sent the payment, the payer's storage had no row, the spent coin stayed spendable and
  the change outputs were lost (testnet). A wallet that cannot make a protected noSend: its error is surfaced
  (`ClientError`), no plain noSend is tried. On any refusal, `abortAction` as before (BRC-177: the wallet sends its
  reclaim).
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.42.3 (the client on the engine 0.42.3).

## 0.42.2 (2026-11-06)

The paid enable as a BEEF submission (open-exchange 0.15.3; David Case: the payment's BEEF in the `X-BSV-Payment`
header is dropped at ~10–16 KB; "this would not be a payment filter, but a beef submission… an API, both sides").
Client only; no page, the programs unchanged.

- `enableTokenPaid(tokenId, {deployBeef?})`: the price from `GET <swap>/defaults`; a BRC-29 payment to the exchange
  built the ts-stack way (createNonce prefix and suffix, the key for the exchange, one P2PKH output of the price,
  `noSend` — not sent: the exchange's take-in sends it); ONE BEEF with the deploy (given, else discovery's) and the
  payment; `POST <swap>/enable?tokenId=&paymentTxid=&paymentVout=&derivationPrefix=&derivationSuffix=` signed; the
  enabled row back. Any refusal or failure aborts the unsent payment (`abortAction`). Refusals: `ClientError` kind
  `refused`, the exchange's code first in the message. (`enableToken` stays the admin's Settings enable.)
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.42.2 (the client on the engine 0.42.2).

## 0.42.1 (2026-11-06)

The admin's withdraw is a standard BRC-29 payment (open-exchange 0.15.2; David Case: "The host should not
broadcast anything… That is how payments work"); client and Settings only, the programs unchanged.

- `withdrawAll()` sends `{fn: "withdraw"}` (no arguments: swap pays the message's sender), waits for
  `GET <swap>/wallet` to list the withdrawal, and takes it in: `internalizeAction` with its output as a
  `wallet payment` (`derivationPrefix`, `derivationSuffix`, `senderIdentityKey` from the read; the BEEF from
  `GET <swap>/wallet/tx?n=`). The take-in is what sends it; nothing waits for a block.
- `settleWithdrawals()` (Settings load) takes the latest withdrawal in again, for a page lost in between.
- Gone: the self-derived key ("amm withdraw" + n) and the action label `amm-withdraw` (client and the pages'
  manifest). Settings after a withdraw: "Withdrawn: N sats are in your wallet."
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.42.1 (the client on the engine 0.42.1).

## 0.42.0 (2026-11-06)

The paid enable and the admin's withdraw, client and Settings only (open-exchange 0.15.0; agent-env
plans/paid-enable-2026-11-06.md Part 2); the programs are unchanged.

- Client: `setEnablePrice(sats | null)` (the admin's `{fn: "price", args: {sats}}`; null: off),
  `Defaults.enablePriceSats`, `exchangeWallet()` (`GET <swap>/wallet`: `{sats, outputs, withdrawals}`),
  `withdrawAll()` (the admin's `withdraw` to a BRC-29 key for self derived from the withdrawal's number:
  prefix base64 "amm withdraw", suffix base64 sha256 of `<swap identity> <n>`) and `settleWithdrawals()`
  (each withdrawal the wallet lacks taken in as a wallet payment from `GET <swap>/wallet/tx?n=`, labelled
  `amm-withdraw`).
- Settings: "Price to enable a token (sats)" (empty = off), "Exchange wallet: N sats" with Withdraw
  (disabled at 0 sats); withdrawals taken in on load. The manifest names the action label `amm-withdraw`.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.42.0 (the client on the engine 0.42.0).

## 0.41.1 (2026-11-05)

- The validator's `pool_spent` refusal whose newest state is CLOSED (`{closed: true, outpoint,
  closedBy}`: the LP's Close ended the lineage) carries `beef` too: the BEEF of the transaction
  that ended it, with its ancestry back to proven ones (`state.beefFor`). The relaying host admits
  it like the other two answers, so its pools list no longer shows that pool when the page reads
  it next (David Case: the validator's answer always carries the new state in full). Nothing else
  changes; no client change.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.41.1 (no code change).

## 0.41.0 (2026-11-05)

Pool events, and the validator's answer carries the transaction (agent-env
plans/swap-balance-build-2026-11-05.md §5, David Case 2026-11-05).

- On skein-overlay 0.20.4 (a lookup hook hands back events) and skein-1color 0.15.3.
- The AMM lookup emits ONE event wherever it writes a history row (deploy, swap, close,
  rescind): `{event: "pool", topic: "ls_amm_<tokenId>", tokenId: "<txid>_<vout>", row}`, `row`
  the history row exactly as `/pools/history` answers it (one reader, `eventRow`, builds both:
  text and numbers only). A rejection emits, per pool whose rows the transaction wrote, `{kind:
  "revert", txid, poolId, at, …}` with the pool as it stands after the undo, or none of those
  when it no longer exists.
- The validator's `pool_spent` refusal carries `beef` (the newest pool output's transaction back
  to proven ones) beside `pool`; the accepted answer carries the BEEF it submitted to its own
  overlay.
- The relay: an answer carrying `beef` is submitted to this instance's own overlay (the token
  topic, amm-validator's submission message) and the relay thread awaits that submission's first
  answer before it settles the record and answers the page, within `expires`; a refusal there is
  said in `detail`, the validator's verdict stands. A local validator needs none of it.
- The client: `executeSwap` reads the server's pool list fresh before EACH leg and keeps no list
  of its own (the refusal-state rows, the `waiting` map and the wait on the stream are gone). The
  stream reader of the pools route goes with no alias (`watchPools`, `applyPoolChange`,
  `parseChange`, `PoolChange`, `watchTokenPools`); new `tokenPools` (the plain read),
  `watchPoolEvents(tokenId | "all", onEvent)` over the host's `/@<token>/amm/events` and
  `<origin>/amm/events`, `parsePoolEventMessage`, `PoolEventMessage`, `PoolRevert`,
  `statsAll({fresh})`.
- The pages: Swap reads the pools with a plain read and again (no cache), re-quoting, on a pool
  event for its token; Landing listens to the `all` feed and reads a token's stats row again (no
  cache) on its pool event; the 30 s read while visible stays.
- gen/vectors: `close_after_token_change`, the LP's Close of the pool `swap_token_change` left
  (it spends swap_token_change:0); every other vector byte for byte.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.41.0 (the engine: no code change).

## 0.40.2 (2026-11-05)

- `maxSources` (required) caps how many pools an order draws on, in place of `allowPartial` (no
  alias): `@dcasegr/amm-engine`'s `PlanRequest.maxSources` (`plan` splits over at most that many
  pools; 1 = the best single pool for the whole amount) and `nextLeg({…, maxSources})` (the legs
  the order may still fill; 1 = the leg takes all that remains). The client's swap request
  carries it; `executeSwap` starts its budget there and takes one off per FILLED leg, so with 1 the
  swap is exactly one leg, retried as one leg within the floor. The fee sats staged are for
  exactly `maxSources` legs (the two-leg leeway is gone). The pages: "Allow partial fill"
  unchecked sends 1, checked sends 5 (`MAX_SOURCES_PARTIAL`, the page's choice).
- `nextLeg`'s take-all rule (it could never fire) and `underEveryMinimum` removed.
- A pool whose newer state a validator returned but whose transaction the host cannot serve yet is
  set aside until the pools stream shows it there; with no other pool to take the leg, the swap
  waits for the stream's next answer or the cancel (no timer, no re-read, no re-relay).
- The Swap quote's sentence: "…, enough for one leg." / "…, enough for up to <N> legs."

## 0.40.1 (2026-11-05)

A leg fed by rows of unrelated transactions (rows a stopped swap left and a fresh stage) reached
the validator's door without some inputs' sources (`MissingInput`). Fixed:

- The relay (amm-p2p `requestBeef`): the request BEEF keeps the ancestry of every swap input whose
  source the given funding BEEF holds, not only the funding transaction's. `checkPair` unchanged.
- The pages / `@dcasegr/amm-client` (`fundingBeef`): `funding` is ONE BEEF of every staged input's
  source (with its ancestry), in an Atomic envelope whose subject is the first sats input's
  transaction; the sdk's own Atomic writer would drop the sources the subject does not descend from.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.40.1: no change.

## 0.40.0 (2026-11-05)

Token change, the pool id, the pool history, one price, the validator's minimum, and the swap with
no balance (agent-env plans/swap-balance-build-2026-11-05.md; David Case, 2026-11-05 night). Pools
of the old script are not carried: close them on 0.39.0's pages first.

- Contract: `Swap(…, commissionPkh, tokenChangePkh, tokenChange)` — one more 1-sat token output of
  `tokenChange` to `tokenChangePkh` after the commission when nonzero, then Rúnar's sats change.
  Validator, relay and call layout follow; `go run ./gen/vectors` (a `swap_token_change` vector).
- Terms: `minLegSats` (absent or 0: none); the validator refuses a leg whose sats side is under it
  (`below_minimum`); `/terms` carries it.
- The pool lookup: `poolId` (the deploy outpoint, copied along its swaps), `swaps`; the history
  (deploy, swap, close, rescind at the admitting step's time) and the closes in time order;
  `{tokenId, poolIds}` replaces `{lpPubKeys}`; `/pools/beef`, `/positions`, `/trades` take
  `?pool=` (no `?lp=`); `/pools/at?t=`, `/pools/history`; trade rows carry `poolId`, `payoutPkh`;
  `/stats` answers `lastTradePrice`. On skein-sdk 0.13.0 (`floor`, `Map.range`), skein-overlay
  0.20.3, skein-1color 0.15.2.
- `@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.40.0: the slippage bound from the plan's own total; `minLegSats` in the
  planner (`unfillable: "min"`); `nextLeg`; `priceOf` (`PRICE_SHARE_BPS` 100).
- `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.40.0 and the pages: the reads by pool id and the new readers (`poolsAt`,
  `poolHistory`, `candles` `series`, `spendsAll`, the stats prices); `applyPoolChange` by `poolId`.
  The swap: ONE wallet action stages what `amm-swap` lacks (the swap amount exact, the fee sats for
  the planned legs and two more; sats only a plain createAction; tokens the module transfer, the
  token key's id in its output description, labelled `amm-swap-stage`); legs ONE AT A TIME over
  `nextLeg`, each spending sats rows and token rows largest first, its token and sats change kept
  in `amm-swap` (`amm-swap-<first input>:change`, with the order), the last leg's change to the
  wallet; one payout derivation per order, the token receipt for self; a refused leg re-routed; no
  answer → the overlay, once more, a race; the leftovers moved back by itself when it stops early
  (`filled | cancelled | floor | min | no_pool | fees`). The overlay pass over every `amm-swap`
  row on load, before a swap and after a refused leg. The quote's price and impact from
  `priceOf`; the Swap page shows what it stages, the miner fee per leg, the legs as they fill,
  Cancel, and why it stopped; the landing's price is the stats' `price`; Your tokens shows the
  swap basket's sats once; Settings' terms gain "Minimum leg (sats)". "Check again" and 0.31.1's
  single repriced retry are gone (the loop does both).

## 0.39.0 (2026-11-05)

The pages and the client on open-exchange 0.13.0's reads (agent-env plans/history-api-2026-11-05.md D7):

- The token's pools stream (`watchTokenPools`, the Swap page): `pools` replaces the held answer;
  each `change` is applied to it — `swap`: the row of `trade.lpPubKey` replaced by `pool`;
  `deploy`: `pool` added; `close` / `rescind`: the row at `outpoint` removed. A change it cannot
  apply (no answer held, an unknown kind, a row not held) → the route is read once more. Swap
  re-quotes after either as before.
- The landing (and every page's token list): no host-wide stream; ONE `GET /amm/stats` per load,
  again every 30 s while the tab is visible — price, liquidity (TVL) and pools, the same columns.
  `watchHostedPools` gone.
- The client: `trades`, `trade`, `candles`, `stats`, `statsAll`, `holders`, `positionsAll` (plain
  GETs of the history routes; amounts bigints, prices `{sats, tokens}`), the `PoolChange` type,
  `applyPoolChange`. `@dcasegr/amm-engine` and `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.39.0.

## 0.38.2 (2026-11-05)

Pins only: the pages and `@dcasegr/amm-client` on `@1sat/actions` 0.1.3 (pages: `@1sat/connect`, `@1sat/react` 0.1.2), the 2026-11-05 `@1sat/*` release (`@1sat/wallet` 0.1.2 under them). 0.38.1's client pinned 0.1.2. No code change.

## 0.38.1 (2026-11-05)

- On skein-1color 0.15.1 (`build.zig.zon`; `bin/color-lookup.wasm` from its tag): color-lookup files
  a deploy by what it holds — a supply-holding deploy is a value output (in `ls_color_<assetId>`'s
  `{tokenId}` answer and the holders), an authority-only deploy an authority. Until 0.15.0 every
  deploy was filed as an authority, an error. The web packages follow the release version
  (`@dcasegr/amm-engine`, `@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.38.1; nothing in them changed). zig 102.

## 0.38.0 (2026-11-05)

The client as two npm packages (agent-env plans/client-packages-build-2026-11-05.md; decisions
D8–D14 in plans/history-api-2026-11-05.md). `web/` only; the pages' behaviour unchanged.

- **`@dcasegr/amm-engine` 0.38.0** (`web/engine`, was the private `@amm-poc/matching-engine`): tsc
  to `dist/` (ESM + `.d.ts`). The pages import it by that name from `../engine/src`.
- **`@dcasegr/amm-client` 0.38.0** (`web/client`, built from `web/ui/src` minus the pages: `ox/`,
  `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `data/exchange.ts`, `components/`, `AppWalletProvider.tsx`, fonts,
  styles): `createClient({origin, feeRateSatsPerKb, wallet, fetch, signedFor?, identityKey?})`
  (`src/client.ts`, D9) binds the reads, the swap, deploy / close / rebalance, Move back,
  positions and the settings to the exchange's origin (or app base), the fee rate (default 100),
  the wallet and the fetch; nothing in it reads `import.meta.env` or `location` (`src/lib/config.ts`
  pure; the pages' env in `src/ox/env.ts`); `withWallet` keeps what was read and quoted. Peers
  `@bsv/sdk`, `@1sat/templates`, `@bsv/color-permission-module`.
- Exports (D10, `src/index.ts`): `POOLS_BASKET`, `SWAP_BASKET`, `SWAP_PROTOCOL`, `SWAP_KEY_PREFIX`,
  `swapKeyID`, `swapInstructions`, `swapSatsInstructions`, `LP_KEY_PROTOCOL`, `LP_KEY_MARK`,
  `lpKeyDescription`, `lpKeyIdOfDescription`, `POOL_TAG`, `POOL_OP`, `isPoolRow`,
  `poolCustomInstructions`, `POOL_DEPLOY_LABEL`, `SWAP_TTL_MS`, `transferPlanLabels`,
  `newReceivingKey`, `receiptOutput`, `xTopics`; nothing renamed.
- **Rebalance** (D11, `src/lp/rebalance.ts`, `rebalancePosition`): ONE wallet createAction — the
  old pool the explicit input unlocked as Close does, output 0 the new pool affirmed by
  `amm.pool.affirm`, more tokens selected by the module / fewer to a module receiving key of the
  user's own (owned output 1), the sats difference to or from the wallet's change; labels the
  plan's + `amm-pool-deploy` + `amm-close`; the new pool filed in `amm-pools`. Not on a page.
- Swap progress (D12): `executeSwap(quote, {onProgress})` reports `staging`, `relaying`,
  `repricing`, `done` / `failed`; Move back returns what it did.
- Error kinds (D13, `src/errors.ts`): `ClientError {kind, message}` for `stale_pool`,
  `fee_mismatch`, `quote_mismatch`, `slippage`, `pool_spent`, `user_rejected`, `no_answer`,
  `refused`, `network`; a failed swap leg carries `kind` beside its text.
- `x-topics` (D14): every submit sends the BRC-22 JSON array (`xTopics`).
- runar-sdk vendored (`web/ui/src/vendor/runar`, MIT, Rúnar d207ee8e: the import closure the pool
  template uses, two import lines edited, NOTICE): runar-sdk 1.0.0-rc.1 is not published; the
  `RUNAR_DIR` alias is gone. Relative imports under `src/` name `.js`.
- vitest 248 (236 + 12; two assertions moved to D13/D14: a failed leg's `kind`, the JSON
  `x-topics`), engine 35.

## 0.37.0 (2026-11-05)

- On skein-1color 0.15.0 (`build.zig.zon`; `bin/color-lookup.wasm` from its tag): color-lookup keeps
  a per-token balance table over P2PKH value outputs. The token instance answers its holders under
  one new prefix read row `/color/` (filter `colorToken` = `color-lookup.token`, the row the
  discovery instance serves at `/`): `GET /@<token>/amm/color/<tokenId>/holders?limit=&skip=` →
  `{count, rows: [{address, balance}]}` largest first (agent-env plans/history-api-build-2026-11-05.md
  §2, D4). The same row answers `/color/<tokenId>` etc. as discovery does; on a token instance (no
  `tm_color`) those are 404. zig 102.

## 0.36.0 (2026-11-05)

The history reads, server side (agent-env plans/history-api-build-2026-11-05.md §1; decisions
D1–D3, D6 in plans/history-api-2026-11-05.md; docs/AMM.md "The history reads"). Programs only.

- **amm-lookup**: one TRADE ROW per admitted Swap, where the 0.33.0 fee row was written (the fee row
  grew into it, `kind: "amm-trade"`; its fee fields unchanged, so `/positions` and the fee reads
  answer as before): txid, lpPubKey, side (`buy` = sats in), amountIn (the call's), amountOut (the
  other asset's reserve before minus after), the three fees, bsvReserve and tokenReserve after the
  Swap, and `at` = the admitting step's time in ms (the in-VM call input's `now`, set by main.zig
  before the hook runs; replay-exact). New map `trades: tp ‖ at (u64 BE) ‖ txid → <the record>`;
  `fees` and `byCommission` link the same record; a rejection removes all three; a re-admission
  keeps one row. No backfill: Swaps admitted before 0.36.0 have no trade row.
- **amm-p2p**: three GET reads (filters `trades`, `candles`, `stats`; JSON; `max-age=5`):
  `/trades?from&to&limit(≤500, default 100)&before&lp` → `{trades, next}` newest first, `?txid=` the
  one row (404 none), each row's `height` from the overlay state's `placed` (null until the proof
  lands); `/candles?tf=1m|5m|15m|1h|4h|1d&from&to` → one candle per non-empty bucket
  `{t, o, h, l, c, volumeSats, volumeTokens, n}`, more than 5000 buckets 400; `/stats` →
  `{tokenId, price, change1h, change24h, volume24hSats, volume24hTokens, buys24h, sells24h,
  lastTradeAt, tvlSats, tvlTokens, pools}`. A price is `{sats, tokens}` (exact; no floats).
- zig 102 (lookup 27, p2p 31).

## 0.35.1 (2026-11-05)

Settings, the enabled token row: Edit and Disable share the row's action cell, the terms editor opens full width under the token line, and Save / Market only / Cancel sit in one row (0.35.0 dropped the editor into the row's grid as a third cell, squeezing the text and pushing Disable onto its own line). Pages only.

## 0.35.0 (2026-11-05)

- Pages only (agent-env plans/per-token-terms-2026-11-05.md; open-exchange 0.12.0): per-token
  validator terms from Settings. `data/exchange.ts` `setTokenTerms(tokenId, terms | null)` =
  root's `{fn: "terms", args: {tokenId, terms: {lpFeeBps, validatorFeeBps, commissionBps} |
  null}}` to swap's `<app>/admin` (swap emits `token-terms`, the host sends it to the token's
  instance as root's `terms`); `tokenTerms(tokenId)` = P7's `validator`. Each ENABLED row in
  Settings' "Enabled" list reads its token's `/terms` once on load and shows `LP <n> · validator
  <n> · commission <n> bps` or "market only"; Edit opens the default terms card's three fields
  (one shared component, `TermsFields`) with Save and Market only; after sending, `/terms` is
  re-read every 500 ms until it shows the change or 10 s pass ("sent, not applied yet"). Enable
  is unchanged (a token is created with swap's defaults); the defaults cards are unchanged.

## 0.34.1 (2026-11-04)

- Pages only (David, review item 8 of 0.34.0): the pools route `GET /@<token>/amm/pools` (P2) carries
  `validators: [{identity, peerId}]`, the validators beating on the token's topic now (the
  open-exchange host adds it; the pools filter is unchanged). Positions marks a position's validator
  live when its identity is in that set, read by ONE plain P2 GET per token the wallet has
  positions in (not a stream), on load; 0.34.0's mark (the pool listed on the host-wide stream) is
  gone. Nothing else changes.

## 0.34.0 (2026-11-04)

The exchange's public read API (agent-env plans/exchange-api-build-2026-11-04.md §B; decisions
D1–D25 in plans/exchange-api-2026-11-04.md §0; the route table in docs/AMM.md "The public read
API"). Plain GETs, JSON unless bytes, comma lists answered one record per key in query order,
cache headers per class. Nothing is removed from `/submit` or `/lookup` (D8).

- **amm-lookup**: the `{tokenId}` rows carry the pool's `lpPubKey` (hex: its id, D2); `lastSeen`,
  `liveOf`, `LiveJoin`, `setLiveJoin` and their README section gone (dead since 0.9.0; the
  liveness join is the host's, D11). The 0.33.0 list queries stay on `/lookup`.
- **amm-p2p read routes** (filters, no handler; reads.zig): `/pools/beef?lp=` (P3: the LP keys'
  current pools — live, or a rescinded pool's output — and ONE base64 BEEF of their transactions;
  no `lp`, every live pool), `/positions?lp=` (P4), `/fees/validator?id=` (P5),
  `/fees/commission?pkh=` (P6) — each the lookup's own list answer (amm-lookup's `answer`,
  imported as a module, the same code over the same index) — `/terms` (P7: the validator's terms
  with this instance's identity and peer ID, and the market's commission key hash and minimum, in
  one, unsigned), `/spends?outpoint=a,b` (P8: one record per outpoint; one outpoint the single
  object as before), `/tx?id=` (P9: the transaction's Atomic BEEF; `immutable` only when proven
  in chain state), `/swaps?id=` (P10: the relay record as `amm.swap.status` answers it,
  unsigned). `/pools` is the host's (P1, P2), not this app's.
- **Pages** (web/ui): the pages send `/lookup` nowhere and read no beats (a test checks the
  sources). Swap holds the token's pools route as an event stream; quotes from it (no request);
  the fee line the pool's own; the market minimum, `useValidatorTerms`, the `.live` reads and the
  10 s price poll gone (D11–D13, D16). A swap reads ONE `/pools/beef?lp=` for its legs, the
  commission key hash and peer IDs from the held pools; expiry 15 s; the submit's held answer is
  the settled record, no poll; no answer yet → "Check again" reads `/swaps?id=` once (D14, D15).
  The landing prices hold the host-wide pools route; the token list is read once per page load
  (D4, D22). Your tokens: ONE discovery `?ids=` for held tokens off the list (D17); the Unfinished
  card and its localStorage store gone, a silent pass over the swap basket's staged legs settles
  them (D18, D24); Move back, Close, the swap-basket send and the deploy submit at
  `<origin>/submit` + `X-Topics` (D19). Positions: ONE `/positions?lp=` per token (D9); a deploy
  in the history with no `amm-pools` row is filed while its pool is still at the deploy's output
  (D23); "Recover a position" gone; Close's pool BEEF by its LP key. Settings: swap's identity
  from the claim card (`instanceIdentity` gone), Enable's deploy from the wallet else discovery's
  `/<token>/deploy`, `?ids=` for wallet-only candidates, the deploy form's terms `/terms` (D20,
  D21).
- Needs, to run as intended: the host's pools routes (skein 0.2.6 + open-exchange 0.11.0, part A)
  and discovery's `/tokens`, `/<token>/deploy` (skein-1color 0.14.0, part C).

## 0.33.0 (2026-11-04)

- **Fee rows in the pool lookup** (agent-env plans/fee-rows-and-reindex-2026-11-04.md, as
  settled with David: no reindex, no backfill, no migration). `ls_amm_<assetId>` writes, when it
  admits a Swap's continuation, ONE row per Swap under the pool's LpPubKey (`fees`: `{lp,
  validator, commission, bsvIn, commissionPkh}`, the three fees in the input asset) and, a
  commission not 0, a membership row under the commission's key hash (`byCommission`);
  `rejected` removes both. **Fee rows exist for Swaps admitted after 0.33.0 is installed**; earlier
  Swaps have none.
- New indexes: `byLp` (`lpPubKey ‖ tp ‖ outpoint`, every listed pool of a key, live and spent);
  `byValidator` now keeps a spent pool's row too (only `rejected` removes either), its single-key
  query still answering the live pools; `rescinded` (`tp ‖ lpPubKey` → the pool record a
  validator's Rescind wrote). The beat stays live-only.
- **List queries**, a set in and one record per key out, prefix scans only (no scan of all pools):
  `{tokenId, lpPubKeys}` → `[{lpPubKey, status, outpoint?, current?, sats, tokens, swaps}]`
  (`status` live: its live pool; rescinded: the Rescind's output, unspent in the chain state, and
  its state, what the LP's Close takes back; closed otherwise, an unknown key included);
  `{tokenId, validatorIdentityKeys}` → `[{validatorIdentityKey, sats, tokens, swaps, pools}]` (the
  validator fees over all its pools' rows, closed included; `pools` distinct LP keys);
  `{tokenId, commissionPkhs}` → `[{commissionPkh, sats, tokens, swaps}]`. Unknown keys answer zeros.
- **Removed**: 0.32.0's `{tokenId, lpPubKey}` query and its lineage walk; `{tokenId, outpoint}` is
  `{current, hops}` again.
- src/pool.zig `feesOf` (was `lpFeeOf`): the three fee outputs a Swap paid, each checked for the
  contract's amount (the LP's and the commission's for their payout script), over the same
  `parseSwapCall` / `feeLayout` the relay uses (relay unchanged).
- Pages: Positions load with ONE `{tokenId, lpPubKeys}` query per token for all the wallet's LP
  keys (the rows from `amm-pools` and the deploy history, as before; their LP key from the filed
  output's script), each position's state and fees from its record; the token list read once; no
  `/spends` and no color-spendability read on load — Close reads the pool output's BEEF when the
  LP acts. A rescinded record keeps today's rescinded card. Manifest version and amm-setup's
  version check 0.33.0.

## 0.32.0 (2026-11-04)

- **LP fees per position** (agent-env plans/lp-fees-by-key-2026-11-04.md, as
  revised by David: no running totals, read at query time). `ls_amm_<assetId>`
  answers `{tokenId, lpPubKey}` → `{lpPubKey, root, sats, tokens, swaps,
  current}`: the LP fees the pool lineage of that LpPubKey (one deploy and its
  Swap continuations) earned, sats from sats-in Swaps and tokens from token-in
  Swaps; `current` the live pool, null once closed; a key with no pool here
  answers zeros with `root` and `current` null. `{tokenId, outpoint}` gains
  `fees: {sats, tokens, swaps}` for its lineage. The lookup finds the deploy
  among the listed pools of that key (`pools`, `spentPools`) by its
  self-attestation, then walks the spends as `{outpoint}` does; a rejected
  Swap is not in the lineage. Nothing new is kept (no new map).
- **One reading of a Swap's fees**: `SwapCall` / `parseSwapCall` moved from
  amm-p2p's relay into src/pool.zig, with `feeLayout` (where the LP, validator
  and commission outputs sit) and `lpFeeOf` (the LP fee output, checked to be
  the contract's); the relay's pair check uses `feeLayout` (behaviour
  unchanged), the lookup `lpFeeOf`.
- Pages: each position carries `feesEarnedSats` and `feesEarnedTokens`
  (`lpFeesOf` by the pool's LpPubKey); the Liquidity card's "Fees earned" line
  shows `<sats> sats · <tokens> <SYM>`; above the cards one line per token,
  "<SYM>: <n> positions · fees earned <sats> sats · <tokens> <SYM>", which
  counts closed positions too (`myPositions` now returns them marked
  `closed`, one per LpPubKey, its key from the filed output's script; no card).
- Manifest version and amm-setup's version check 0.32.0.

## 0.31.4 (2026-11-04)

- **The Swap page's wallet sats come from the toolbox's balance special
  operation** (agent-env plans/wallet-sats-balance-2026-11-04.md):
  `walletSats()` = one `listOutputs({basket: specOpWalletBalance})`, its
  `totalOutputs`; before, it listed the `default` basket, which
  wallet-toolbox's permissions manager keeps admin-only, so a page's read
  was refused and the "Wallet: N sats" line and the overspend check were
  off. The manifest's group permissions grant that basket ("Read your
  wallet's sats balance"). Programs unchanged; manifest version and
  amm-setup's version check 0.31.4.

## 0.31.3 (2026-11-04)

- On skein-overlay v0.20.2 (`bin/overlay.wasm`) and skein-1color v0.13.3
  (`bin/color-*.wasm`, unchanged): `rebeat` re-declares the liveness of the
  configured lookup services (`config.overlay.lookups`) too, as the
  registered ones'. Programs unchanged; manifest version and amm-setup's
  version check 0.31.3.

## 0.31.2 (2026-11-04)

- **`rebeat` re-declares the liveness window too** (agent-env
  plans/rebeat-redeclares-liveness-2026-11-04.md): on skein-overlay
  v0.20.1 (`bin/overlay.wasm`) and skein-1color v0.13.2
  (`bin/color-*.wasm`). A topic's liveness window was declared once, at
  registration; the rack's token instances registered before
  skein-overlay 0.20.0 kept a 40 s window under 120 s beats, so a
  validator looked offline two thirds of the time. amm-validator's
  `rebeat` (sent on root's `terms`) now re-declares every topic's
  liveness with the market's window beside its beacon, and each
  registered lookup service's liveness. Programs unchanged.
- The manifest version (`etc/app.json`) and amm-setup's version check,
  left at 0.31.0 by 0.31.1, are 0.31.2.

## 0.31.1 (2026-11-04)

- **Swap: a leg refused `pool_spent` is repriced and sent once more**
  (David: fix the identified issues; agent-env
  plans/swap-retry-pool-spent-2026-11-04.md). When two swaps race on one
  pool, the validator refuses the second `pool_spent` and returns the
  pool's newest state. `executeSwap` now re-quotes that leg alone against
  it (the engine's `computeSwap`, same side, same amount in) and, ONCE per
  leg, if the order's bound holds (the filled legs' amount out + the new
  one + the legs still out at their quote ≥ the plan's
  `resolvedMinAmountOut`; the plan has no per-leg minimum), rebuilds it on
  the new pool output (`lookupPoolOutput`, `planSwapLeg`, `prepareSwap`)
  with the same staged `amm-swap` rows, writes a new pending entry (the old
  one is already removed by the refusal) and relays it to the same
  validator (another key named: its live peer, else "the pool's validator
  changed"). Below the bound: "repriced below your minimum: <amount out>
  for this leg", nothing sent. A second refusal fails the leg as before; a
  refusal without a state, a timeout, a failure or no answer are
  unchanged. `LegResult.repriced`; the Swap result adds "One leg was
  repriced after another swap moved the pool." Pages only. vitest 234
  (+5).

## 0.31.0 (2026-11-04)

- **The relay's dialled frame names the token's topic** (agent-env
  plans/relay-dial-topic-2026-11-04.md). amm-p2p's package to a validator
  on `/amm-validator/1/swap` is `{message, body, topic}`: `topic` =
  `tm_color_<assetId>` from the head `amm/token` (`names.overlayOf`), at the
  frame's top level, outside the signed record. A host running several
  instances on one libp2p node routes a stream by its first frame's
  `topic` (skein `p2p.ts` `streamHandle`); without it the rack answered
  `topic required`, the relay recorded `bad_reply` and the page said "no
  answer yet". amm-validator's `messages.open` reads `message` and `body`
  by name and ignores `topic` (tested). The in-VM affirm package names no
  topic; the local relay's package names it (harmless, the same frame).

## 0.30.0 (2026-11-04)

- **Your tokens: Send a token to a BRC-169 handle** (David: "Yes";
  agent-env plans/send-to-handle-2026-11-04.md). A row with a balance gets
  "Send" beside its status; an inline form under the row (one open at a
  time): Handle, Amount (`parseInput` with the token's decimals; nothing,
  zero or more than the balance refused with one line before any wallet
  call), Memo (optional); Send / Cancel, "Sending…" with every input
  disabled. `sendTokens(tokenId, handle, amount, memo?)` calls @1sat/actions
  `send1Color` (chain from `getNetwork`), which resolves the handle, builds
  ONE createAction through the wallet's 1Color module (a BRC-177 noSend
  handoff, label `p nosend expiry seconds 31536000`) and delivers it
  (BRC-232) to the handle's messagebox; the recipient's wallet submits and
  takes it in. Delivered: the form closes and the row says "Sent <amount>
  <sym> to <handle>" with the txid (8 chars, full in the title) until the
  row's next action. An error with no transaction: the SDK's text in the
  form. Built but not delivered (`delivery-failed`): the row says the send
  was built but not delivered and the tokens are in the pending send until
  it expires; no retry, no abort.
- **Manifest**: `[2, "metanet handles envelope"]` with counterparty
  `anyone` (send1Color signs the envelope to `anyone`, the string the
  manager keys the grant by), `[2, "message encryption"]` (no counterparty:
  the recipient's key; wallet-toolbox's group check skips a level-2 entry
  without one, so it is asked per send), `[1, "action label BRC-177 noSend
  expiry"]` (the toolbox's built-in BRC-177 module takes every
  `p nosend expiry …` label and asks this one fixed label, not
  `action label p nosend …`). The per-asset key and the module's consent
  for the `p color` transfer still prompt per send.
- @1sat/actions 0.1.1 → 0.1.2. Pages only. vitest 229 (+15).

## 0.29.6 (2026-11-03)

- **Unfinished: Dismiss for a swap that was never signed** (David: "that's
  something you need to fix"). A swap entry is written before the relay
  runs (`final: false`) and cleared only by a take-in, so a leg that timed
  out or was refused stayed forever. An entry with `final === false` and no
  bytes of its own gets "Dismiss" beside Finish (`dismissUnfinished`:
  `PendingPayoutStore.remove`, nothing else; aria-label "Dismiss: forget
  this unsigned swap; nothing was paid to you"). A final entry and an
  old-shape one (receipt / remittance bytes) get none: they are the only
  pointer to money. Texts unchanged.
- **Move back for staged sats alone.** `swapTotals` counts, per token, the
  sats of the `amm-swap` sats rows naming its `assetId`; Your tokens lists a
  token with only sats staged (balance 0) and its swap-basket line reads
  "In the swap basket <tokens> · <N> sats staged"; Move back is offered for
  tokens or sats. `moveBack` with token rows is unchanged (module plan,
  sweeps the sats rows). With no token row and ≥1 sats row: ONE plain
  createAction (`moveBackSats`: no `p color` labels, labels `["amm-swap"]`),
  the sats rows explicit inputs (108-byte unlocks, sources in `inputBEEF`),
  NO outputs — the wallet keeps them as its change and pays the fee; the
  page's P2PKH unlocks at signAction (`runAppSignedAction`); the wallet
  broadcasts and marks the rows spent itself; nothing submitted, nothing
  taken in, nothing kept. Proven against the real wallet-toolbox 2.15.0
  (Wallet + StorageKnex + WalletPermissionsManager + color module 0.1.0,
  MockServices validating every script): accepted with `outputs: []`, two
  sats rows in (7,500), one change output (7,465), the rows
  `spendable=false`, another token's row untouched, the module not called.
- Pages only. vitest 214 (+9).

## 0.29.5 (2026-11-03)

- **The validator's submission is a fully proven BEEF** (David: "So fix it").
  The kernel's door (skein `door.zig`, since c6dbbb0) verifies every BEEF
  with skein-sdk `chain.spv.verify` and no known transactions, and the
  relay's request carries the taker's ancestry, never the pool's
  transaction: every relayed swap was refused `MissingInput` at the door
  and its relay record waited out `expires` (ovh, 2026-11-02 and 11-03).
  `messages.finishSpend` now merges the chain state's Atomic BEEF of the
  pool's transaction (skein-overlay `state.beefFor`: back to proven
  transactions) into the submission (`submit.submissionBeef`, `merged`):
  BUMPs combined per block, a transaction both carry kept once (the proven
  one), parents first, the swap still the subject. No BEEF of the pool's
  transaction → refused `submit_refused`, nothing submitted. The Rescind's
  submission takes the same merge (`submit.withPool`; the wallet's Atomic
  BEEF already carries it: a no-op there).
- Programs only: the relay (`amm-p2p`) and the pages are unchanged (pages
  as 0.29.4). The programs had not changed since 0.24.1 but for this.
- zig 80 (a new test: a relay request without the pool → the submission
  carries it with its BUMP and passes `chain.spv.verify` with `knownRaw`
  none; the pre-fix shape fails `MissingInput`; a request that carries the
  pool is not duplicated); vitest untouched.

## 0.29.4 (2026-11-02)

- **The deploy's LP keyID is in its pool output description, not a label**
  (David: a per-deploy label asks for permission every time). The LP key
  stays random. The deploy createAction's pool output description is the
  readable text as before plus the suffix: `AMM pool: <SYM> / BSV · amm-lp
  <the derivationSuffix's 16 bytes, lowercase hex>` (`lpKeyDescription`).
  The readable part stays at most 50 characters, and the sdk takes up to
  2000 bytes. The wallet's permissions manager stores it encrypted and
  answers it verbatim through `listActions`. Recover and Positions read it
  from `listActions({labels: ["amm-pool-deploy"], includeOutputs,
  includeOutputLockingScripts})`, output by output (`lpKeyIdOfDescription`).
  The `amm-lp <hex>` label, `lpKeyLabel` and `lpKeyIdOfLabels` are gone.
  Recover's internalize writes no description: a BRC-100 internalize output
  has none. The deploy's own action still names the key.
- vitest 205; zig 79.

## 0.29.3 (2026-11-02)

Pages only (web/ui). David's D and E, decided 2026-11-02.

- **Move back and Close are module plans** (E). Each is ONE createAction
  through the wallet's BRC-207 module: a `p color plan` transfer whose
  `ownedOutputs` names output 0 (the token output to a NEW module receiving
  key of the user's own, sender the user's identity). The module checks the
  output pays that key and files it in `p color <assetTag>` with its custody
  in the same call. To the module the `amm-swap` rows and the pool are
  FOREIGN explicit inputs (not in a `p color` basket): checked admitted and
  unspent on the token's overlay (a sats row adds nothing). The page unlocks
  them at signAction; the module approves and submits; the wallet broadcasts.
  Move back takes every `amm-swap` row of the token (tokens and its sats);
  Close has no payout output, so the pool's sats go to the wallet's change.
  No internalizeAction afterwards, no receipt kept, no pending entry.
  `completeClose`, `awaitAdmitted`, `paymentCustomInstructions` and
  `MovedBack.internalized` are gone.
- **The deploy's LP key is named in its own action** (D). The LP key stays
  random (BRC-29 to self, base64("amm-lp") + 16 random bytes). The deploy's
  createAction carries the label `amm-lp <the derivationSuffix's bytes,
  lowercase hex>` (`lpKeyLabel`; the wallet lowercases labels, so not
  base64; 39 characters). A Recover's own action carries it too.
  `historyPoolRows` reads `listActions({labels: ["amm-pool-deploy"],
  includeLabels, includeOutputs, includeOutputLockingScripts})`: the keyID
  from the label (`lpKeyIdOfLabels`), the pool from the output's script.
  It is the FIRST source for Positions and Recover; the `amm-pools` row
  stays as before. `PendingDeployStore` is gone.
- **Unfinished steps** (E). The pending-payout store is now a to-do list
  with no key material. Only swaps write it, one entry per payout output:
  `{id, kind: "swap", txid, vout, tokenId, base, createdAt, final}`.
  - Writing and clearing work as before: written before the relay, cleared
    only when the wallet accepted the take-in.
  - "Finish" (`internalizeNow`) finds the final transaction in the token
    instance's pools, re-derives the key from its inputs (`legDerivation`)
    and checks that output `vout` pays it (`swapPayoutOf`), then takes it in.
  - Your tokens shows an "Unfinished" card only while the list is not empty,
    one Finish per entry; on failure the error shows inline and the entry
    stays. There is no automatic retry.
  - Entries from before 0.29.3 (receipt or remittance, script, AtomicBEEF,
    as Dan's move back) are listed and finished once with their own bytes.
    Nothing writes those fields any more.
- vitest 205; zig 79.

## 0.29.2 (2026-11-02)

- **The `amm-swap` staging keys are derived, not random** (David). In the
  swap-basket send (the module send and the plain sats send) each staged
  output's keyID comes from its leg's pool outpoint as quoted
  (`leg.outpoint`, `<txid>_<vout>` written `<txid>.<vout>`): the token row
  `amm-swap-<txid>.<vout>`, the sats row `amm-swap-<txid>.<vout>:sats`
  (`swapKeyID`); protocol `[2, "amm swap"]` and counterparty self as before;
  customInstructions carry the keyID as before. A leg refused and retried
  against the same pool outpoint stages to the same key again.
  `SwapStage` is `{tokens: {amount, pool}[], sats: {satoshis, pool}[]}`;
  `sendSatsToSwapBasket` takes `{satoshis, pool}[]`.
- vitest 203.

## 0.29.1 (2026-11-02)

Pages only (web/ui). David's corrections to 0.29.0, decided 2026-11-02.

- **Close has ONE path: the wallet createAction**, for every pool. The
  page-built close (`bsvFee` > 0, the fee left from the pool) is gone, and
  with it the `bsvFee` number, the Close card's fee field and its help text
  (the card now says the wallet pays the miner fee), `CloseRequest.bsvFee`,
  `CloseResult.tokensTo`, `PreparedClose.walletBuilt` / `version` / `tokens`,
  `CloseInput.satsPerKb`, `LEGACY_FEE` and `LEGACY_LP_KEY` (a non-BRC-29 LP
  key is refused as "not a BRC-29 key to self"). Every sat of the pool goes
  to the LP's BRC-29 payout; the tokens to a module receiving key.
- **Layout 1 (pools before 0.13.0) is dropped** (decided 2026-10-22; every
  testnet pool is layout 2). `src/pool`: the v1 artifact
  (`pool.v1.artifact.json`, `poolArtifactV1`) is deleted, `PoolVersion` is
  `2`, `decode` matches layout 2 only (a layout-1 script, the testnet's
  AMM1 pool included, is no pool), `Pool.affirmation` (the v1 payload) is
  gone, `planClose` / `close` take the LP's `outputs` only (no `bsvFee`, no
  `Close(sig, bsvFee)` arguments). `src/lp/recover.ts`: the walk back to a
  v1 deploy's input 0 (`keyInputCandidates`, `findLpKey`), the pre-0.13.0 LP
  keys (`lpDerivation`, `lpKeyId`, `legacyLpKeyId`, `LP_KEY_PREFIX`, the
  `P1SAT_PROTOCOL` keys), `keyInput` and the `notMine` / `noDeploy` notices
  are gone: the deploy history's keys, then the browser's kept keys.
  Positions: no `legacy` flag; the Close card's "tokens land in the swap
  basket" text is gone.
- **Move back sweeps the token's sats rows.** Sats rows now name the token
  whose swap staged them (`{sats: true, assetId, …}`; `sendSatsToSwapBasket`
  takes the token id); Move back's createAction takes every `amm-swap` row
  of the token, the token rows and its sats rows, as explicit inputs; the one
  token output is unchanged and the wallet's change absorbs the sats. The
  legs still select any sats row of the exact amount.
- **Deterministic payout keys for swap legs.** A leg's payout key (the
  BRC-29 sats payment, or the BRC-207 receipt) and the taker's own
  commission key are derived from the leg's first staged `amm-swap` input,
  `<txid>.<vout>` (display hex): tokens in, its first token row (the swap's
  input 2); sats in, its sats row (input 1). derivationSuffix =
  base64(sha256(UTF-8 of that text)); derivationPrefix = base64("amm swap")
  for the payout, base64("amm swap commission") for the commission
  (`legDerivation`, `legKeyInputOf`). The receipt's sender is still the
  pool's validator; the BRC-29 sender the user. `planSwapLeg` sizes the leg
  with placeholder addresses and makes no wallet call; `prepareSwap` derives
  the keys and re-plans (the sats must match). The pending-payout records
  are written exactly as before (David: "just because it is deterministic
  doesn't mean we will know that we didn't complete the internalization").
- vitest 203; zig 79.

## 0.29.0 (2026-11-02)

Pages only (web/ui). Decided with David after walking the swap, deploy and
close call by call (plans/wallet-built-flows-2026-11-02.md); the browser
stores (pending payouts, pending deploys) are unchanged.

- **The swap-basket send carries the legs' sats.** One send per swap stages
  everything the legs spend in `amm-swap`: tokens in, the module send
  (`sendToSwapBasket`, `{tokens, sats}`) has the per-leg token outputs and
  after them ONE P2PKH sats output per leg not covered (exactly the leg's
  `swapFunding` amount) to a fresh `[2, "amm swap"]` key, filed in
  `amm-swap` by the createAction itself (customInstructions `{sats: true,
  protocolID, keyID, counterparty}`; the module passes a non-token output
  through); sats in, or tokens already staged, a plain createAction
  (`sendSatsToSwapBasket`, no `p color` labels). A leg's input 1 is its sats
  output (`SatsInput`, `satsInputsOf`, `selectExactSatsInput`: exact amounts
  only), signed with `createSignature` like the token inputs; the relay's
  `funding` is that output's transaction (AtomicBEEF). `prepareSwap` is split:
  `planSwapLeg` (plan, payout keys, the exact sats) then `prepareSwap`
  (`planned`, `satsInput`, `holdingBeef`). `createFunding`, the funding
  noSend action, `abandonSwap`'s abortAction, `1sat-deposit`, the hold tag
  and `amm-funding` are gone; a refused or timed-out leg leaves its outputs
  in `amm-swap` for a later swap. `swapTotals` (Your tokens) counts tokens
  only; the sats rows are shown nowhere.
- **Move back = ONE wallet createAction** (`moveBack`): `inputBEEF` = the
  basket's BEEF, `inputs` = every `amm-swap` token output of the token
  (`unlockingScriptLength` 108), one output to a NEW module receiving key
  with the receipt as its customInstructions (no basket), labels
  `["amm-swap"]`, `randomizeOutputs: false`; the page's unlocks go to
  `signAction` (`src/wallet/action.ts` `runAppSignedAction`, aborted on any
  failure before the signatures); the wallet funds the fee, adds change,
  broadcasts. Then the submit, the admission wait and the module take-in as
  before. A failed submit after the wallet's broadcast is reported, not
  thrown, so the receipt is kept as a pending payout.
- **Close = ONE wallet createAction** (layout 2, `bsvFee` 0): the pool an
  explicit input (`inputBEEF` the lookup's, `unlockingScriptLength`
  `PoolTemplate.maxCallUnlockLength`), outputs `planClose`'s with the
  payout's `paymentCustomInstructions` and the receipt; the page fills input
  0 over the wallet's transaction (its change included: Close(lpSig)'s
  outputs are free) at signAction. `closePosition` waits for the topic's
  admission of the token output before the take-in. `bsvFee` > 0: unchanged
  (the fee from the pool, page-built). A layout-1 pool now needs `bsvFee` > 0
  (no funding transaction to pay its fee).
- **No relinquishOutput anywhere** (David: "Anything we internalize should
  relinquish outputs itself"): `completeSwap`, `moveBack`, `completeClose`
  call none; `CompletedSwap` / `CompletedClose` / `MovedBack` have no
  `relinquished`.
- Manifest: `1sat-deposit` leaves `basketAccess`.
- Proven against the real wallet-toolbox 2.15.0 (Wallet + StorageKnex/SQLite
  + WalletPermissionsManager, the class Yours's LocalWalletPermissionsManager
  extends; MockServices as the network, which verifies every input script)
  and the real @bsv/color-permission-module 0.1.0, outside this repository
  (the toolbox is not a dependency here): the toolbox takes `amm-swap` rows
  and a pool (held or foreign) as explicit inputs with the page's unlocking
  scripts, marks them spent (`spentBy` the action), and an internalized
  foreign swap marks its `amm-swap` input spent; customInstructions on an
  output with no basket are in storage when the transaction is broadcast;
  the manager routes no createAction or signAction of these flows to the
  color module; the module's `planOutput` returns a sats output with basket
  `amm-swap` unchanged.
- vitest 205 (new: the swap-basket send's tokens + sats output set, the
  sats-only send, Move back's and Close's createAction / signAction shapes
  against fake wallets that place explicit inputs first, a sats-in
  `executeSwap`), zig 79.

## 0.28.2 (2026-11-02)

- The pages keep no liveness window of their own (David, 2026-11-02:
  one judgement, made by the instance). The token instance's
  `GET <base>/.live/<topic>` already returns only the beats inside its
  window (`config.overlay.market.window`); the pages re-filtered that list
  against a hardcoded 40 s (`LIVE_WINDOW_MS`, from the 30 s beat days), so
  with the 2-minute beat the Swap page said no validator had beaten though
  the instance reported it live. `LIVE_WINDOW_MS` and every `windowMs`
  parameter are gone (`parseLiveBeats`, `noLiveness`, `mergeLive`,
  `fetchLive`, `fetchLiveByToken`); `LiveAnswer` has no `windowMs`; every
  beat the read returns is `live` (`at`, `ageMs` kept for "seen N s ago").
  The planner's message is "no pool's validator is live on this token".
  `src/lib/overlay.ts`, `src/market/plan.ts`, `test/swap.test.ts`.

## 0.28.1 (2026-11-02)

- Deploy a position fills the other side at the market rate (David,
  2026-11-02). With a market price for the token (the "market price now"
  number), typing in Tokens fills Sats = tokens × price (whole sats,
  rounded) and typing in Sats fills Tokens = sats ÷ price (the token's
  decimals, rounded at the last place). The field typed last is the
  source; both stay editable. Changing the token (or the market price
  arriving) re-derives from the source. No pools: no filling, as before.
  `src/ox/deployFill.ts`, `test/deployFill.test.ts`.

## 0.28.0 (2026-11-02)

- The claim grants the configure right, not root (David, 2026-11-02: "The
  end user, the one connecting with their wallet, is the one who is able to
  configure and enable. The host is the host."; open-exchange 0.5.0: swap
  is born owned by the host's key). `claimStatus` reads swap's
  `GET <base>/admin` (`{claimant?, since?}`; a swap without it: its
  `/.well-known/skein` `claimed`, as before); `claimExchange` sends
  `{fn: "claim"}` in the swap app's box `amm/claim` to swap's identity (was
  the kernel's box `claim`, `{}`); `isRoot` (name kept) = the wallet is the
  claimant, or the host's `/skeins?key=` lists swap. Settings: the claim
  card while `/admin` names nobody — alone for anyone else, above the admin
  cards for root; the not-admin line and the lead say admin, not root.
- Positions and Recover see pools whose output the wallet already marked
  spent (the LP swapped against its own pool): `historyPoolRows` reads
  `listActions({labels: ["amm-pool-deploy"], includeOutputs: true})` and
  takes every output filed in `amm-pools` as a pool row, deduped with the
  basket's (`mergePoolRows`), each followed by `/spends` as before (closed
  pools stay out; two rows that reach the same pool list it once). Recover
  tries those rows' LP keys before the keyIDs kept in this browser. Pages
  only.

## 0.27.1 (2026-11-02)

- One BRC-104 session per instance (David, 2026-11-02: "fix the page").
  The pages built ONE `AuthFetch` and used it for every base; the SDK's
  AuthFetch keeps one session per origin and shakes hands at
  `<origin>/.well-known/auth`, which the router gives to the root instance
  (swap), so every signed request to a token instance
  (`<origin>/@<tokenId>/amm/...`: lookup, the pool's output, `amm.pool.terms`,
  `amm.pool.affirm`, `amm.swap.terms`, the relay) came back unsigned and the
  wallet refused it ("without valid BSV authentication"). Pool deploy,
  Recover and Close were broken on every exchange since tokens became their
  own instances (0.17.0). Now `src/lib/skein.ts` `authFetchPerInstance`
  keeps one AuthFetch per instance (origin + `/@<handle>` prefix), and a
  prefixed instance's handshake goes to `<origin>/@<handle>/.well-known/auth`
  (the fetch wrapper copied from skein's `src/client/raw.ts`; no skein
  dependency). Every token-instance call takes its own instance's client;
  swap's (claim, admin messages, its token list) its own. Pages only.

## 0.27.0 (2026-10-30)

- Your tokens: one first-visit approval covers the list (David,
  2026-10-30). `myTokens` takes each token's balance from the one `p color
  assets` read, the sum of its held value outputs (`buildInventory`); it no
  longer reads `p color balance <assetTag>` per token (one "Grant Item
  View" prompt per token on first visit). `assetBalance` stays in
  `src/wallet/color.ts` for a per-token page; nothing calls it today (the
  Swap page's "you hold" line reads the list's balance, as before).
- `public/manifest.json` `metanet.groupPermissions.basketAccess` lists
  `p color assets` (the wallet grants it with the group in one popup, into
  the store its 1Color module reads); the group description no longer says
  the module "asks you each time".
- The Settings nav link shows to root and, while the exchange is unclaimed
  (`claimStatus` → `claimed: false`), to any connected wallet: since 0.26.0
  made `isRoot` real, a non-root wallet never saw the link and could not
  reach the claim card. Hidden while that read is pending, as before. The
  Settings page itself is unchanged. Pages only.

## 0.26.0 (2026-10-30)

- The Open Exchange admin is a claim (David, 2026-10-30): swap is set up
  unclaimed, and Settings, while nobody holds root on it (`claimStatus`:
  skein 0.1.2's `GET <swap>/.well-known/skein` → `claimed: false`), shows
  ONE card, "Claim this exchange", with one button: `claimExchange` sends
  the wallet's own message in box `claim` to swap's identity (what `skein
  claim` sends) and reads `isRoot` again. `isRoot` is real: the host's
  `GET <origin>/skeins?key=<wallet key>` names swap's identity (was a
  stub: every connected wallet). Claimed by another key: the not-root
  line. Pages only.

## 0.25.0 (2026-10-30)

- Settings, "Enable a token" (David, 2026-10-31: "One list, one click per
  token"): the typed token id and the pasted BEEF are gone; the card lists
  the tokens on discovery (`<origin>/@discovery/1color/color/tokens`) and in
  the connected wallet (`p color assets`) that are not on this exchange's
  list yet, each with one Enable. `enableToken(tokenId)` takes the deploy's
  BEEF from the wallet's module basket, else from discovery's `ls_color`
  lookup at the host root (`deployBeef`, which `deployMeta` uses too), else
  refuses naming both; `EnableSent.beefFrom` is `"wallet" | "discovery"`.
  Pages only.

## 0.24.1 (2026-10-30)

The settled overlay sync design (David, 2026-10-30): skein-overlay v0.20.0
and skein-1color v0.13.1 (were v0.19.0 and v0.13.0).

- `bin/overlay.wasm` (skein-overlay 0.20.0): announce, then fetch — the
  `<topic>` mesh carries only the engine's `admit` verdicts and the host
  fetches the BEEF from the announcer; a paused submission asks nobody (no
  `want` events); every proof the chain app takes is published (a reorg's
  too); the sync protocol's `tail` read; beat defaults 120 s / 300 s (this
  app's manifest sets none).
- `bin/color-topic.wasm`, `bin/color-lookup.wasm` from skein-1color 0.13.1
  (byte-identical to 0.13.0's). `bin/amm-p2p.wasm` and
  `bin/amm-validator.wasm` rebuilt on the new contract modules (no source
  change).
- The receive row `/skein/overlay/beef/1.0.0` stays in the manifest: it is
  the host's own entry, not served to peers (skein's host never handles it
  inbound); the manifest's description says so.
- `image/token` installs skein-chain v0.7.1 (a reorg broadcasts nothing).
- Manifest version 0.24.1. Pages (`web/ui`) unchanged.

## 0.24.0 (2026-10-30)

Undecided is not rejected (David, 2026-10-30): skein-overlay v0.19.0 and
skein-1color v0.13.0 (were v0.18.0 and v0.12.1).

- `bin/overlay.wasm` (skein-overlay 0.19.0): a topic manager's
  `MissingParents` failure is no verdict — the submission pauses, wants the
  named sources (not in the BEEF, not held) from the peers that announced
  it, and is judged again as each arrives; nothing is recorded as rejected.
  The topic-call carries `unheld`.
- `bin/color-topic.wasm` (skein-1color 0.13.0): a token transfer whose token
  inputs' sources cannot be read fails `MissingParents`; a deploy needs no
  parents. `bin/color-lookup.wasm` rebuilt there.
- The AMM's four programs rebuilt on the new contract modules (no source
  change). Manifest version 0.24.0. No page, route or image change.
- zig: 79; vitest unchanged.

## 0.23.0 (2026-10-30)

The config app leaves (shruggr/open-exchange#1): skein-amm is the AMM
library, Open Exchange the distributable.

- Removed: `apps/config` (its manifest, `bin/amm-config.wasm`, `www/`),
  `programs/amm-config`, `image/config`, `scripts/www.sh`,
  `scripts/color-pages.sh`. The swap app (shruggr/open-exchange `apps/swap`,
  program `config`) is amm-config 0.22.0 moved and changed there; its pages
  are built there from this repository's `web/ui` at a tag.
- `web/ui`'s build writes `dist/` (not committed); `--outDir` for a caller.
- The token app's tree no longer carries the config app's pages (about
  4.6 MB less in each token instance installed from this tag).
- zig: 79 (the pool library and four programs); vitest 159.

## 0.22.1 (2026-10-30)

The page library (`web/ui`) reads the Open Exchange's swap instance
(shruggr/open-exchange#1; skein #164; skein-amm#5): root's decisions are
facts, the host makes the instances. The pages themselves are built by
shruggr/open-exchange (its `apps/swap/www`); the token app is unchanged.

- `/tokens` rows: `status` is `enabled` or `disabled`; no `url`, `reason`
  or `delivered`. A token's instance is computed: `tokenBase(tokenId,
  base)` = `<origin>/@<tokenId>/amm` (`src/lib/config.ts`).
- `/discovery`: `{on, since?}`; no status machine, no `url`.
- Settings: each token enabled or disabled (Disable; Enable again for a
  disabled one, with no BEEF: the swap instance keeps its deploy); the
  Discovery switch on or off; the "being created…", "starting…" and
  "failed" texts gone.
- `apps/config` (still here, with its 0.22.0 pages) is left as it was; it
  goes in the next release, now that open-exchange carries the swap app.
- vitest: 159.

## 0.22.0 (2026-10-30)

The token app's setup on the deploy event (shruggr/skein-amm#5; David
2026-10-29/30; skein #164; plan amm-setup-on-deploy-2026-10-30).

- New program `amm-setup` (programs/amm-setup): the step on the event
  route `deploy` (box `amm/deploy`, filter `kernel.beef`, handler
  `amm-setup.deploy`). The event `{kind: "deploy", beef}` after the door:
  the BEEF read back from the envelope (`chain.record.wireOf`), the deploy
  its subject's first output that deploys (`src/deploy.zig` `deployIn`:
  output 0 for a BRC-162 deploy, the first deploying inscription for a
  legacy BRC-161 one). In one step: the head `amm/token` = `{tokenId,
  topic, lookup, ammLookup, sym, dec, icon?, txid, vout}`; the engine
  called in-VM (skein-overlay 0.18.0): `register {topic: tm_color_<id>,
  program: "color-topic", seed: [<txid>]}`, `registerLookup {service:
  ls_color_<id>, program: "color-lookup", topics: [tm_color_<id>]}`,
  `registerLookup {service: ls_amm_<id>, program: "amm-lookup", topics:
  [tm_color_<id>]}`; a refused registration fails the step. A deploy the
  seed does not take (the register's `missing`: the door stores the
  blocks, the chain app holds only what is ingested) is submitted to the
  engine by message, `{fn: "submit", args: {beef, topics:
  [tm_color_<id>]}}` from the instance to itself in `amm/submit` (the
  validator's form). Refused, logged, nothing written: the head
  `amm/token` exists ("this instance has its token"), not a deploy event,
  no door envelope, no deploy in the subject.
- The read `GET /amm/token` (filter `token` → `amm-setup.token`): the
  record as JSON, 404 before the event.
- `src/deploy.zig`: the deploy read from a BEEF, moved out of
  programs/amm-config/src/tokens.zig (`deployOf`, `canonicalId`,
  `dataUrlOf`, `ammLookupName`, re-exported there; behaviour unchanged) and
  `deployIn` added; `Deploy` carries `txid` and `vout`.
- skein-overlay v0.18.0 (f66ee73) by tag URL and hash; `bin/overlay.wasm`
  copied from it. `config.overlay` stays `{}`.
- The config app (amm-config, apps/config) unchanged in behaviour: its
  create still passes the configured names; that path is superseded by
  shruggr/open-exchange#1.
- Needs skein main fa8077c or later (an event route may name `kernel.beef`
  in an app manifest and a dispatch row; a5c1897's host refused it at
  install).

## 0.21.1 (2026-10-29)

0.21.0's token manifest dropped `config` entirely; skein derives the
overlay engine's routes (the box `amm` as `event` and `mailbox`,
`/submit`, `/lookup`) from the MANIFEST's own `config.overlay` (skein
`src/host/manifest.ts` `overlayWiring`; an install's `--config` is merged
after), so an in-place install of 0.21.0 removed those four rows from the
instance. `etc/app.json` carries `config: {overlay: {}}` again (no lookup,
no topic); the amm-p2p/amm-validator manifest tests back as in 0.20.1
(they read `config.overlay`). Manifests 0.21.1.

## 0.21.0 (2026-10-29)

The AMM lookup named per asset (David, 2026-10-29: a lookup service name is
advertised network-wide, so two providers under one name must answer over
the same data; each token instance's AMM lookup indexes a different token's
pools; plan ls-amm-per-asset-2026-10-29).

- amm-config: a token's create names the lookups `{ls_amm_<id>: {program:
  amm-lookup}, ls_color_<id>: {program: color-lookup, topics:
  [tm_color_<id>]}}` (`tokens.ammLookupName`; `manifest_lookups` gone); the
  create's and start's `topics` are `[tm_color_<id>, ls_color_<id>,
  ls_amm_<id>]`. Discovery unchanged.
- Token app `etc/app.json`: no `config` (its default lookup `ls_amm`
  removed: a token instance's lookups are its create's; 0.21.1 puts
  `config.overlay: {}` back); descriptions of
  both manifests; version 0.21.0.
- amm-lookup: comments and `documentation` name `ls_amm_<assetId>` and its
  beat `ls_amm_<assetId>-live`; the INDEX name stays `ls_amm` (the head
  `<app>/ls_amm`, no migration).
- Pages: `ammLookupService(tokenId)` (lib/overlay.ts) / `ammLookupOf`
  (data/exchange.ts) in place of `AMM_LOOKUP_SERVICE` / `AMM_LOOKUP`, the
  asset id as `colorQuery` forms it; prices read `ls_amm_<assetId>-live`
  per token instance; query bodies unchanged.
- A token instance created before 0.21.0 keeps `ls_amm` until its config
  names the new lookups (`install --config`) and a disable/enable gives its
  row the new `topics`.

## 0.20.1 (2026-10-29)

The lookups in BRC-207's query form, no shape of ours (David, 2026-10-29,
correcting 0.20.0).

- skein-1color v0.12.0 → v0.12.1 (tag URL and hash; `bin/color-lookup.wasm`
  copied from it: `ls_color` answers BRC-207's query with `topic:
  "tm_color"`; 0.12.0's `{txid, outputIndex}` deploy answer and the
  per-asset name's extra queries withdrawn); `scripts/color-pages.sh` at
  v0.12.1 (sha256 7d55df85…3674).
- Pages: `deployMeta` asks the host root `{"service": "ls_color", "query":
  {"type": "color-admission", "version": 1, "assetId": "<txid>_<vout>", "topic": "tm_color", "outpoints": ["<txid>.<vout>"]}}` (`deployQuery`). A token instance's outputs by outpoint ask
  `ls_color_<tokenId>` BRC-207's `color-spendability` (positions, recover:
  `colorOutput`) or `color-admission` (the move back's admission wait,
  `awaitAdmitted`), topic `tm_color_<tokenId>` (`colorQuery`).
- zig build test 79; vitest 159; `apps/config/www/` rebuilt; manifests
  0.20.1.

## 0.20.0 (2026-10-29)

One lookup name per topic (David, 2026-10-29: "There should be no
difference between what these things are looking up. The only difference
is which topic the instance has got access to."; plan
ls-color-rename-2026-10-29).

- skein-1color v0.11.4 → v0.12.0 (tag URL and hash; `bin/color-lookup.wasm`
  copied from it: `ls_color_deploys` gone, `ls_color` answers a deploy
  `tm_color` admitted at its outpoint `{txid, outputIndex}`, spent or not,
  and `ls_color_<assetId>` answers `ls_color`'s queries besides BRC-207's);
  `scripts/color-pages.sh` at v0.12.0 (sha256 8b0bc80c…39ec), the 1Color
  pages in `apps/config/www/color/`.
- amm-config: a token's create names the lookups `{ls_amm,
  ls_color_<id>: {program: color-lookup, topics: [tm_color_<id>]}}` (no
  `ls_color`, no `ls_color_deploys`); create/start `topics` unchanged.
  Discovery's create: `{topics: {tm_color: color-topic}, lookups:
  {ls_color: {program: color-lookup, topics: [tm_color]}}}`, create/start
  `topics: [tm_color, ls_color]`.
- Token app `etc/app.json`: `config.overlay.lookups` is `ls_amm` alone;
  descriptions of both manifests; version 0.20.0.
- Pages: a deploy's metadata (`deployMeta`, Your tokens for a token the list
  does not carry) asks `ls_color {txid, outputIndex}` at the HOST ROOT (the
  pages' origin, plain fetch), not `/@<tokenId>` (a token not enabled here
  has no instance: the lookup threw and Your tokens showed ids only). A
  token instance's outputs by outpoint (positions, recover, the move back's
  admission wait) ask `ls_color_<tokenId>` there instead of `ls_color`
  (`colorLookupOf`). The Discovery card's text.
- zig build test 79; vitest 159; `apps/config/bin/amm-config.wasm`,
  `bin/color-lookup.wasm` and `apps/config/www/` rebuilt.
- Running instances keep the lookups their create named until their config
  is reinstalled (README "Discovery").

## 0.19.0 (2026-10-29)

The holders' "request to list a token" is removed (David Case 2026-10-29:
it is not part of Open Exchange as a product; a marketplace host adds its
own mechanism).

- amm-config: the box `amm/requests` (`{fn: "request"}` from anyone), the
  head `amm/requests`, the read route `/requests` (filter `requests`) and
  `programs/amm-config/src/requests.zig` are gone. A request recorded by
  an earlier version stays in the instance's state, unread.
- Pages: Your tokens drops "Add to this exchange" (`requestListing`) and
  the "Requested" mark; a token not on the list reads "Not on this
  exchange". Settings drops "Requests to list" and its "Enable…" pick;
  Enable a token takes a typed token id. `listingRequests`,
  `useListingRequests`, `readRequests`, `WireRequest` gone.
- zig build test 79 (amm-config 8); vitest 157; `apps/config/bin/amm-config.wasm`
  and `apps/config/www/` rebuilt.

## 0.18.1 (2026-10-29)

The create/start ask names the topics the host routes to the instance
(shruggr/skein#137; David Case 2026-10-29: "This is a host routing rule.
Why does the instance care at all?").

- amm-config: a token's `create` gains `topics: [tm_color_<tokenId>,
  ls_color_<tokenId>]`, and a stopped token's `start` (re-enable) carries
  the same; discovery's `create` and `start` gain `topics: ["tm_color",
  "ls_color_deploys"]`. `stop` unchanged. skein main fef7823 or later
  routes a bare-host `/submit` / `/lookup` by them.
- zig build test 80 (amm-config 9); vitest 158 (pages unchanged).

## 0.18.0 (2026-10-28)

The discovery toggle (shruggr/skein#137; David Case 2026-10-28: discovery is
its own instance, and the Settings page turns it on and off).

- amm-config: root's `{fn: "discovery", args: {on: true | false}}` in
  `amm/admin` (role root): on, the manager's `create {handle: "discovery",
  image: <tokenImage>, config: {amm: {overlay: {topics: {tm_color:
  color-topic}, lookups: {ls_color, ls_color_deploys: {topics:
  [tm_color]}}}}}}` (no beef, no terms, no market), or `start` when it was
  stopped; off, `stop`. The record under `amm/discovery` (`{on, status,
  since, url?, reason?}`, src/discovery.zig); the read `/discovery`.
- The pages: Settings "Discovery", one switch with its status and url
  (root only). Enabling a token does not submit its deploy to discovery;
  the 1Color deploy page submits each deploy to `tm_color` at the pages'
  origin, routed by skein (main 2eafff1) to the instance that declares it.
- zig build test 80 (amm-config 9); vitest 158.

## 0.17.0 (2026-10-28)

The Open Exchange as a config instance and one token instance per token id
(shruggr/skein-amm#4; David Case 2026-10-27/28). Two apps, both `amm`; two
images, `image/token/` and `image/config/` (`image/` is gone).

- The token app (`etc/app.json`, 0.17.0): no `register` box, no
  `roles.root` `register` / `registerLookup` / `deregisterLookup`
  (`[rescind, terms, market]`), no pages, no holders' requests. Its topic
  and lookups come from its create's config. `config.overlay.terms` is the
  initial validator terms and `config["amm-p2p"].market` the initial market
  minimum (src/terms.zig `current`, market.zig `current`: the head first, a
  record or its `null`, else the config's); amm-validator signs for every
  topic the engine serves (configured or registered); amm-validator ignores
  its own answer to root looped back (root is the instance's own key on a
  one-key host).
- The config app (`apps/config/`, program `amm-config`): root's `enable
  {tokenId, beef}` (the deploy checked, the manager's `create` with the
  token's config and the BEEF), `disable` (`stop`), `enable` of a stopped
  token (`start`), `defaults {terms?, market?}`; the reads `/tokens`,
  `/defaults`, `/requests`; the holders' requests (moved from amm-p2p);
  the pages.
- The pages (served by the config instance): the token list from
  `/tokens`, every per-token read and call at that token's instance
  (`tokenBase`); Settings: Enable a token (BEEF from the wallet's module
  basket or pasted), the enabled list with Disable / Enable again, Default
  validator terms, Default market minimum. Pages built into
  `apps/config/www/`; the 1Color pages copied beside them.
- Engine skein-overlay v0.17.0 (configured topics and lookups beat;
  `config.overlay.terms`, shruggr/skein-overlay#8). Needs skein with the
  manager's `create {…, beef}` (skein main 61a39e0).
- zig build test 78 (pool 11, amm-lookup 15, amm-validator 23, amm-p2p 22,
  amm-config 7); vitest 155.

## 0.16.3 (2026-10-27)

The host chain (shruggr/skein#156): the image installs skein-chain **v0.7.0**
(tree a0b7e769), whose chain state points at the host chain's record instead
of copying headers (the host sends a `chain` event at install, at each start
and once per block; a fresh host bootstraps its chain from the image). Engine
skein-overlay v0.16.1 and skein-1color v0.11.4: chain/state read through
skein-sdk v0.12.0's one opener `chain.open` (shruggr/skein-sdk#1). amm-p2p,
amm-validator and amm-lookup read the chain state through the engine
(`engine_vm.load`, the lookup handler) and change no source; `bin/` rebuilt
(the engine and the 1Color components copied from their tags). No behaviour
change in this app; the pages and `www/` are unchanged.

## 0.16.2 (2026-10-27)

The pages depend on the published packages directly: `@1sat/*` 0.1.1 and the
upstream `@bsv/sdk` 4.0.0, `@bsv/templates` 2.1.0,
`@bsv/color-permission-module` 0.1.0 and `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client` 2.15.0
(released 2026-10-23). The interim `@bopen-io` repack aliases and their
`overrides` are gone; `npm ls @bsv/sdk` shows one upstream copy. No page
behaviour changes.

## 0.16.1 (2026-10-26)

The Settings page's register seeds the token's topic with its deploy
(`seed: [<deploy txid>]`, skein-overlay 0.7.8), as the 1Color pages do.
Without the seed the topic started empty: the wallet module's deploy check
(BRC-207 `admission` on `ls_color_<assetId>`) then refused every pool
deploy of that token ("the overlay has no admitted deploy for …", AMM3 on
swap, David Case 2026-10-26). Registering again fills an existing topic.
`etc/app.json` 0.16.1; www/ rebuilt, www/color unchanged. vitest 152.

## 0.16.0 (2026-10-24)

Market terms are a runtime record root sets: a minimum commission the
market lists by; the commission key derived, not configured
(shruggr/skein-amm#3; David Case 2026-10-24: the market half of the
validator's terms, one record for the whole skein for now, per-token
overrides the release shape, not built).

- amm-p2p: root's message `{fn: "market", args: {minCommissionBps}}` in
  the box `amm/amm-p2p` sets the market record (an integer, 0 to 10 000;
  any other shape refused `bad-args`, nothing written), `{fn: "market",
  args: null}` clears it; kept as the root of the head `amm/market`
  (src/market.zig: `{minCommissionBps}`, or `null` once cleared). Answered
  to root `{fn: "market", request, replyTo, result: <the record> | null}`
  in that box. Unset: 0. `roles.root` gains `market`.
- amm-p2p: `amm.swap.terms` answers `{commissionPkh, minCommissionBps}`.
  The commission pkh is hash160 of the instance's own key for the relay:
  BRC-43 security level 1, protocol `amm commission`, key ID `relay`,
  counterparty anyone, through the signer (`commissionKey`), as the
  validator's keys are derived. The relay is otherwise unchanged: it
  passes a commission-charging swap only when the commission pays that key
  (`commission_missing`), and refuses nothing by the minimum (a listing
  preference of this market, not a rule: David 2026-10-24, "Are you
  putting in work to limit things you shouldn't be?").
- `config.amm.commission` (and genesis `defaults.ammCommission`) is
  removed from `etc/app.json`, the code and the docs; `etc/app.json` has
  no `config.amm` now.
- Pages: Swap lists, and quotes over, only the pools whose commission is
  at or above `amm.swap.terms`'s `minCommissionBps`, and says "N pools
  below this market's minimum commission" when it hides any (nothing when
  none; with no wallet connected the minimum is not read and nothing is
  hidden). Settings gains a root-only "Market terms" card beside
  "Validator terms": the minimum, Set / Clear through the connected wallet
  (root's BRC-104 message into `amm/amm-p2p`). www/ rebuilt; www/color
  unchanged.
- Tests: zig pool 10, amm-lookup 15, amm-validator 23, amm-p2p 21 (69);
  vitest 152.

## 0.15.0 (2026-10-24)

Validator terms are a runtime record root sets; no fee numbers in the
image (shruggr/skein-amm#2; David Case 2026-10-23: "The configs should not
be published in the image. This will be a dynamic, competitive
marketplace."). Terms set: this skein is a validator; unset: a market
only.

- amm-validator: root's message `{fn: "terms", args: {lpFeeBps,
  validatorFeeBps, commissionBps}}` in the box `amm/validator` sets the
  terms (each an integer, 0 to 10 000; any other shape refused
  `bad-args`, nothing written), `{fn: "terms", args: null}` clears them;
  kept as the root of the head `amm/terms` (src/terms.zig: the record
  `{lpFeeBps, validatorFeeBps, commissionBps}`, or `null` once cleared:
  the kernel has no head delete). The step answers root `{fn: "terms",
  request, result: <the record> | null}` in the box it wrote to and sends
  the instance itself `{fn: "rebeat"}` in box `amm`, so the engine
  re-declares every topic's beat with the new terms. `affirm` and the swap
  signing read the record: none set, both refused `not_validating`, "no
  terms: this skein validates nothing", before anything is checked or
  signed. Root's `rescind` is unchanged (it does not need terms).
- amm-p2p: `amm.pool.terms` answers the record with this validator's
  identity and peer ID, or the error "no validator here" when none is set.
  `amm.swap.terms` (the relay's commission pkh) is unchanged.
- `config.amm.ammValidator` is removed from `etc/app.json`, the code (no
  fallback to genesis `defaults.ammValidator` or to 30/5/0) and the docs.
  `roles.root` gains `terms`.
- Engine: skein-overlay v0.15.1 → v0.16.0 (shruggr/skein-overlay#7: the
  beat's `terms` from the head `amm/terms`, not `config.overlay.terms`;
  `rebeat`); `bin/overlay.wasm` is the tag's (sha256 bb2f16fe…0022).
  skein-1color v0.11.2 → v0.11.3 (the same engine pin; `bin/color-*.wasm`
  the same bytes; `scripts/color-pages.sh` pins the v0.11.3 tarball, sha256
  9b706994…0372, `www/color/` unchanged).
- Pages: Settings gains a root-only "Validator terms" card — the terms
  `amm.pool.terms` answers, "This exchange validates nothing: no terms are
  set." when none, and Set / Clear through the connected wallet (root's
  BRC-104 message into `amm/validator`). Liquidity's deploy shows that
  sentence in place of the terms and disables Deploy; Swap shows it in
  place of the fee line when there is no quote. The recipient of root's
  messages and of a listing request is now the key the instance's signed
  answer carries (`x-bsv-auth-identity-key`, off `amm.swap.terms`, as the
  1Color tokens page reads it), since a market only refuses
  `amm.pool.terms`. The unused `DEFAULT_LP_FEE_BPS` /
  `DEFAULT_VALIDATOR_FEE_BPS` and the pages' 30/5/0 fallbacks are gone.
- Tests: zig pool 10, amm-lookup 15, amm-validator 23, amm-p2p 19; vitest
  150.

## 0.14.2 (2026-10-23)

Engine 0.15.1: pending-parent pause (shruggr/skein-overlay#6). A
submission whose parent is held but not yet admitted now pauses and
resumes on the parent's admission. Nothing else changes in behaviour; the
pages, the contract, the manifest's rows and the image are unchanged.

- skein-overlay v0.15.0 → v0.15.1 (tag URL and hash; skein-sdk v0.11.1
  through it, unchanged): `bin/overlay.wasm` is the tag's engine (sha256
  2b11a447…6f02).
- skein-1color v0.11.1 → v0.11.2 (tag URL and hash; the same engine pin):
  `bin/color-*.wasm` the same bytes; `scripts/color-pages.sh` pins the
  v0.11.2 tarball (sha256 5be817d2…40a1) and `www/color/` is unchanged.
- `etc/app.json`: version 0.14.2; the description names both pins.

## 0.14.1 (2026-10-23)

The receive row (shruggr/skein#154). A local node catching up from the
rack's `swap` pulled the ranges and fetched the transactions over libp2p,
then refused every fetched BEEF: "no route for
libp2p:/skein/overlay/beef/1.0.0". The host hands each Atomic BEEF a
catch-up fetches to the engine's receive row, as from the serving peer,
and the manifest did not declare it. Nothing else changes in behaviour;
the pages, the contract and the image are unchanged.

- `etc/app.json`: the route `{"transport": "libp2p", "address":
  "/skein/overlay/beef/1.0.0", "filters": ["kernel.beef"], "handler":
  "overlay.submit"}`, as in skein-overlay's own manifest, beside the sync
  row; the description names it and the new pin.
- skein-1color v0.11.0 → v0.11.1 (tag URL and hash; the same row in its
  own manifest): `bin/color-*.wasm` the same bytes;
  `scripts/color-pages.sh` pins the v0.11.1 tarball (sha256
  0b49e277…14af4) and `www/color/` is unchanged.

## 0.14.0 (2026-10-23)

The sync row (shruggr/skein-overlay#5, shruggr/skein#154; David,
2026-10-23: each app declares the engine's sync filter and the libp2p read
row in its own manifest, no handler). A peer's catch-up from an amm
instance failed at the locator (`/amm/anchors`: not found): the host
answered sync frames through the app's http table, which has no such
reads. Now the engine answers them through the front door. Nothing else
changes in behaviour; the pages, the contract and the image are unchanged.

- `etc/app.json`: `filters.sync = "overlay.sync"` and the route
  `{"transport": "libp2p", "address": "/skein/overlay/sync/1.0.0",
  "filters": ["sync"]}`; the description names it and the new pins.
- skein-overlay v0.14.1 → v0.15.0 (tag URL and hash): `bin/overlay.wasm`
  is its build (sha256 45a2d8f1…dc267, the tag's committed bytes).
  amm-lookup, amm-validator and amm-p2p rebuilt against it: the same bytes.
- skein-1color v0.10.1 → v0.11.0 (tag URL and hash; its sync row and the
  same engine): `bin/color-*.wasm` the same bytes; `scripts/color-pages.sh`
  pins the v0.11.0 tarball (sha256 865113dd…15e58) and `www/color/` is
  unchanged.
- A host serves the row once it takes shruggr/skein#154 (until then its
  kernel refuses a libp2p row with no handler): do not install 0.14.0 on a
  host without it.

## 0.13.2 (2026-10-23)

The Swap page showed tokens without symbol or decimals. The pages asked
the token list (`GET <base>/color/tokens`, skein-1color's `color-lookup`
`tokens`) with `limit=1000`; the route takes `limit` 1 to 100 and answered
an error the pages read as an empty list. `readTokenList` now reads 100 at
a time (`skip`) until a short page. Contract, programs, manifest and image
unchanged.

## 0.13.1 (2026-10-22)

A BEEF out of order is sorted, not refused (David Case, 2026-10-22). A
wallet's Atomic BEEF (ts-sdk's writer: a proven child before its proven
parent) was refused `NotParentsFirst` by the chain app's ingest on swap.

- **The image** installs shruggr/skein-chain **v0.6.1** (tree a3e1f859):
  its ingest sorts the BEEF parents-first, then runs the same SPV
  (skein-sdk 0.11.1 `beef.sorted`).
- **The engine**: `bin/overlay.wasm` is skein-overlay **0.14.1**'s (its
  decode, the door's envelope and the per-transaction Atomic BEEFs sorted).
- **amm-validator**: `unprovenParents` walks the request's BEEF sorted, so
  every parent is found and each parent's Atomic BEEF is parents first.
- **amm-p2p**: the relay's one BEEF takes the funding's ancestry from its
  BEEF sorted.
- Nothing else changes: the pages, the contract and the manifest are
  0.13.0's.

## 0.13.0 (2026-10-22)

The validator sign-off redesign (David Case, 2026-10-22; agent-env
plans/validator-signoff-2026-10-22.md §1, §2, §7, §9; docs/AMM.md).

- **Contract** (pool/Pool.runar.go): state gains `Nonce` (32 bytes) and
  `Affirmation` (the validator's DER signature), never assigned, carried by
  every continuation; no BRC-162 payload any more. `Close(lpSig)`: a plain
  signature by the LP key, outputs free. `Rescind(validatorSig)`: the pool
  written back at output 0 with ValidatorPubKey 33 zero bytes, everything
  else kept, the validator's change after it; Swap (unchanged) is impossible
  after it. The template grows from 2,657 to 3,568 bytes (a pool output from
  2,996 to 4,011).
- **The affirmation**: message v2 (`"skein-amm affirm 2"`, no termsHash, the
  nonce last; 221 bytes); the first validator key is the identity's child
  keyed by the nonce (64 hex digits); `amm.pool.affirm {pool, satoshis}` →
  `{validatorPubKey, nonce, signature}` (no `keyInput`; the validator picks a
  random nonce).
- **ls_amm**: lists a pool that attests itself (the key derived from
  identity + nonce, compared, the affirmation verified) or a Swap's
  continuation of a listed pool naming the next key (the identity's child of
  the spent outpoint); a rescinded pool, a Close's output and any other key
  are not listed.
- **amm-validator**: root's `close` → `rescind` (rescind.zig); the current
  key: a Swap's continuation by the spent outpoint, else a self-attesting
  pool by its nonce.
- **Pages**: the deploy names no input (outputs [pool], no `inputPositions`;
  the module selects the token inputs); the LP key a fresh random BRC-29
  keyID kept in the row (and in the browser until the row is filed); the
  Close pays the tokens to a new module receiving key and the sats as a
  BRC-29 payment (no `amm-swap`, no Move back); Recover takes both layouts;
  pools before 0.13.0 decode, close (their covenant outputs) and recover.
- Fixtures regenerated (`pool_deploy_own_key`, `swap_bad_next`, `rescind`,
  `close_rescinded`; `close_fee` and `close_validator` gone); the 0.12.x
  artifact and vectors kept for the pages' layout-1 path.
- Tests: Go 8 (73 with subtests), `zig build test` 63, web/ui 144, web/engine 35.

## 0.12.1 (2026-10-22)

Pages only (`web/ui`, `www/`): no contract, validator, lookup or manifest
change.

- **Recover a position** (Liquidity, src/lp/recover.ts): paste a pool
  outpoint (`<txid>.<vout>` or `<txid>_<vout>`, the deploy's or a later
  one); the pool is followed to its current output (`/spends`), read from
  `ls_color`, walked back through its BEEF to the deploy, and its LpPubKey
  checked against the wallet's LP key for the deploy's input 0 (BRC-29,
  else pre-BRC-29). A match is filed in `amm-pools` as a deploy files it
  (`poolCustomInstructions`, label `amm-pool-deploy`); no match files
  nothing. A pool already filed is left alone. Close is unchanged.

## 0.12.0 (2026-10-22)

The pages (`web/ui`, `www/`) move onto the wallet's BRC-207 1Color module
(David Case, 2026-10-21/22; docs/AMM.md "The pages and the wallet's
module"). Nothing outside the pages changed: `bin/`, the contract, the
fixtures and `www/color/` are 0.11.0's.

- **Dependencies**: `@1sat/*` 0.1.0 (published), `@bsv/sdk` 4.0.1,
  `@bsv/templates` 2.1.0, `@bsv/color-permission-module` 0.1.0 and
  `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client` 2.15.0 through the interim `@bopen-io`
  repacks (npm aliases and `overrides`; one copy of `@bsv/sdk`). The
  template is 1sat-sdk's `OneColor` (was `Mandala`; `src/pool/oneColor.ts`).
  The local 1sat-sdk checkout alias (`ONESAT_SDK_DIR`, aff025c3) is gone.
  The `mandala <txid> <vout>` and `bsv21` baskets and their custom
  instructions are gone.
- **Your tokens**: the module's assets (`p color assets`) and balances
  (`p color balance <assetTag>`, exact); metadata from the token list, else
  `ls_color_deploys`, else a held deploy; what the active swap basket holds,
  with Move back.
- **Pool deploy**: `amm.pool.affirm`, then ONE createAction (key input at
  index 0, the affirmed pool at output 0 as a transfer to a foreign script,
  the key input's rest to a fresh module key, `randomizeOutputs: false`);
  the module funds the tokens and submits; the page submits too and files
  the pool in `amm-pools`. Gone: the funding transaction, SIGHASH_SINGLE,
  the claim, `amm.pool.submit` (`lp/deployFlow.ts`, `lp/poolRelay.ts`),
  `completePoolDeploy`, `abandonPoolDeploy`, a position's "rescinded".
- **Swaps**: tokens in, the legs spend the active swap basket `amm-swap`
  (keys `[2, "amm swap"]`, counterparty self); the legs it does not cover
  get an output each from ONE module send before the legs. Token payouts
  (and the taker's own token commission) go to a module receiving key, the
  pool's validator the sender, taken in with a receipt. Pending payouts
  keep receipts as well as BRC-29 remittances.
- **Close**: the tokens (paid by the contract to the LP key) are filed in
  `amm-swap`; Move back takes them into the wallet.
- **Move back**: every `amm-swap` output of a token, with a broadcast
  funding for the fee, to one module receiving key of the user's own;
  submitted to the token topic; taken in through the module.
- **Manifest**: baskets `amm-swap`, `amm-pools`, `1sat-deposit`; protocol
  `[2, "amm swap"]` (self) added; `bsv21`, `1sat` and `[0, "onesat"]`
  dropped; no spending authorization; no `p color` entry.

## 0.11.0 (2026-10-22)

Pool deploys move to the BRC-207 wallet module (David Case, 2026-10-21):
the LP's wallet builds, signs and broadcasts the deploy as one action and
the module submits it to the token topic, so the validator can no longer
append its claim to a delivered deploy. The claim, as a token unit paid to
the validator, is gone; the validator's consent is recorded at deploy in the
pool output itself, and delisting is the contract's Close. A contract
change: the Pool script, its artifact and every fixture are new.

- **The contract** (`pool/Pool.runar.go`): `Close(sig, bsvFee)` takes the
  LP key or the current validator key. The payout is always the LP's (the
  pool's sats less bsvFee, then every token in one BRC-162 value output). On
  the validator's path bsvFee must be 0: bsvFee > 0 checks `sig` against the
  LP key alone; bsvFee 0 checks it as one of the two keys (a 1-of-2
  `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`, so a validator's signature is never a failed
  `OP_CHECKSIG`, which NULLFAIL forbids). Swap is unchanged.
- **The affirmation** (docs/AMM.md "The deploy and the affirmation"):
  `amm.pool.affirm {pool, satoshis, keyInput}` → `{signature}` (amm-p2p,
  `writes: false`; it calls amm-validator's new fn `affirm` in-VM). The
  validator checks the proposed pool against its terms and its key, and
  signs, by the pool's validator key, sha256 of the 221-byte message
  `"skein-amm affirm 1" ‖ AssetId ‖ the three fees ‖ TokenReserve ‖ the
  pool's satoshis ‖ LpPubKey ‖ ValidatorPubKey ‖ ValidatorIdentity ‖
  termsHash`. The deploy's pool output carries the signature as its BRC-162
  payload (`<push sig> OP_DROP` after the prefix; the contract never reads
  it; continuations carry none). src/pool.zig `affirmMessage`, `affirmed`,
  `withAffirmation`; web/ui `PoolTemplate.affirmationMessage`, `affirmed`,
  `lockDeploy(args, state, affirmation)`.
- **The listing** (`ls_amm`): a deploy's pool is listed only when its
  affirmation verifies against its parameters and the ValidatorPubKey in its
  state; a Swap's continuation of a listed pool is listed; a Close (the LP's
  or the validator's) ends it. Only listed pools are indexed. The claim rule
  (`claims`, `spentClaims`, `NotListed`) is gone.
- **The validator's Close** replaces the rescind: root's `{fn: "close",
  args: {pool: "<txid>.<vout>"}}` in the box `amm/validator` (roles: root's
  `close`). amm-validator follows the pool to its newest output and has the
  instance's wallet build the Close with the pool as a caller input
  (createAction, then signAction with the Rúnar call: the pool's current
  validator key's signature, bsvFee 0, the wallet's change as Rúnar's), the
  wallet paying the fee; submits it to the token topic and answers root.
- **Gone:** `amm.pool.submit` and `amm.pool.status` (the delivered deploy,
  SIGHASH_SINGLE pairs, the unassigned unit), libp2p
  `/amm-validator/1/deploy`, the claim's filing in the wallet (`amm-claims`),
  root's `rescind`.
- **Fixtures** (`go run ./gen/vectors`): `pool_deploy` is a plain wallet
  deploy (token input and funding, ALL|FORKID) whose pool carries the
  affirmation; `pool_deploy_unaffirmed` and `pool_deploy_forged` must not
  list; `close_validator` (the validator's Close of pool 2, its own funding)
  replaces `rescind`; `pool_deploy_delivered`, `pool_deploy_wrong_key` and
  `claim_vout` are gone. Zig and the pages reproduce the affirmation and the
  validator's Close byte for byte.

**Not in this version:** the pages. The Liquidity page still builds 0.9.0's
delivered deploy and calls `amm.pool.submit`, which no longer exists; its
move to the wallet's BRC-207 module and `amm.pool.affirm` is the next build
(docs/AMM.md "Not wired"). `www/` is rebuilt for the template only.

## 0.10.2 (2026-10-21)

The Exchange's "Deploy a new token" link points at the app's own base
(`<origin>/amm/color/deploy/`) instead of `color/deploy/`, which at the
skein's root resolved to `/color/deploy/`, where the 1Color pages find no
app name in their URL and skip the overlay submit. `www/` rebuilt; nothing
else changed (`bin/`, `www/color/` as in 0.10.1).

## 0.10.1 (2026-10-21)

Re-pinned onto shruggr/skein-1color 0.10.1 (d7348cf, tree 7342c1df): its
pages, copied into `www/color/` by `scripts/color-pages.sh`, deploy through
the wallet's BRC-207 `color` module (`@1sat/actions` 0.1.0 `deploy1Color`,
the basket `p color <txid>v0`) instead of `deployMandala` and the basket
`mandala <txid> 0`. skein-1color's programs are unchanged, so `bin/` is
unchanged. The AMM's own pages (`web/ui`) are as in 0.10.0.

`web/ui/test/manifest.test.ts` follows 690e754 (the manifest asks for no
`spendingAuthorization` on connect, David Case 2026-10-21): the test still
expected it. The manifest itself is as 690e754 left it.

## 0.10.0 (2026-10-21)

Re-pinned onto shruggr/skein-1color 0.10.0 (the 1Color rename; BRC-162
retitled 1Color) and shruggr/skein-overlay 0.14.0; the image moved here from
skein (shruggr/skein#152). Decided with David Case, 2026-10-21. The
Open Exchange's flows are as in 0.9.1.

**Pins** (`build.zig.zon`): `skein_1color` v0.10.0 (3de96c4, tree
b51ad172) in place of `skein_mandala` v0.9.2; `skein_overlay` v0.14.0
(385e1b9). `bin/color-topic.wasm` and `bin/color-lookup.wasm` are
skein-1color 0.10.0's, `bin/overlay.wasm` skein-overlay 0.14.0's (the same
bytes as skein-1color 0.10.0's engine); `bin/amm-*.wasm` rebuilt (a clean
rebuild, fresh caches, gives the same bytes). The programs compiled against
0.14.0's engine sources and contracts unchanged: amm-validator's topic
judgement names no ancillary txids (0.13.0's verdict field stays empty),
and 0.14.0's beat fields and its reads `/holds`, `/anchors`, `/admitted` are
the engine's (this manifest routes none of them, as skein-1color's does
not).

**BRC-207's wire names**, no aliases:

| until 0.9.1 | 0.10.0 |
|---|---|
| `tm_mandala_<assetId>`, `tm_mandala_<txid>_0-live` | `tm_color_<assetId>`, `tm_color_<txid>_0-live` |
| `tm_mandala` (discovery) | `tm_color` |
| `ls_mandala_<assetId>` | `ls_color_<assetId>` |
| `ls_mandala`, `ls_mandala_deploys` | `ls_color`, `ls_color_deploys` (index head `<app>/ls_color`) |
| `mandala-spendability`, `mandala-admission` | `color-spendability`, `color-admission` |
| programs `mandala-topic`, `mandala-lookup` | `color-topic`, `color-lookup` |
| read `/mandala/tokens`, filter `mandala-lookup.tokens` | `/color/tokens`, `color-lookup.tokens` |
| pages `www/mandala/` (`<base>/mandala/`) | `www/color/` (`<base>/color/`) |
| Zig module `mandala` | `1color` (`@import("1color")`) |
| `scripts/mandala-pages.sh` | `scripts/color-pages.sh` (skein-1color v0.10.0's tarball, sha256 9211e792…) |

The asset id stays `<txid>_<vout>`, `_0` included. The pages say 1Color
where they said Mandala. The SDK's names are unchanged: the template is
still imported as `@1sat/templates/mandala` (`Mandala`), and 1sat-sdk's
basket `mandala <txid> <vout>` and label `mandala` are what it files.

**After upgrading a running skein from 0.9.1**: the 1Color lookup's index
head is now `<app>/ls_color` (it was `<app>/ls_mandala`), so it starts
empty; the registrations under `tm_mandala_*` / `ls_mandala_*` are not
recognised by the new programs (`color-topic` and `color-lookup` take only
`tm_color_*` / `ls_color_*`, and amm-lookup, amm-validator and amm-p2p only
`tm_color_*`). Root registers each token again under the new names (its
topic, its lookup, and `ls_amm`), and drops the old ones.

**The image** (`image/etc/apps.json`, shruggr/skein#152: skein's
`images/open-exchange` removed): the chain app (shruggr/skein-chain v0.6.0
by release tarball and tree id 13a517e9…) then this app (`..`), and root's
routes `/submit`, `/lookup` and `/`, as the old image had them (README.md
"The image").

**The pages** (`www/`) were built from the same 1sat-sdk source as 0.9.1's
(the embedded-icon draft, aff025c3): the bundle is 0.9.1's with only the
names and the words changed. web/ui gains `@ipld/dag-cbor` and `cborg` as
dependencies, deduped and mapped like `cbor2`, because the template's
sources import them and the checkout has no `node_modules`.

Tests: `zig build test` 70/70 (as 0.9.1: the names, the manifest's
`/color/tokens` route, and the old names refused); web/ui 133/133; web/engine
35/35.

## Before 0.10.0

The README's notes, as they stood at 0.9.1 (0.9.1: on skein-overlay 0.12.1
and skein-mandala 0.9.2):

0.8.1: on skein-overlay 0.12.0 and skein-mandala
0.9.1 (skein-sdk v0.11.0, skein log format 10: the BEEF envelope beside the
pointer record, shruggr/skein#146), every skein a market and a validator
from install, always (David Case, 2026-10-09: no switch; the Validator
page shows both always on), the token topic's gossip one mesh for submit
and admit messages with `-proof` and `-live` separate, each registered
topic's beat body its view digest; the pages at the origin root (`/`,
shruggr/skein#147) take `<origin>/amm` as the app's base. 0.8.0: on
skein-overlay 0.11.0 and skein-mandala
0.9.0 (BRC-207; David Case, 2026-10-08), a token's topic is
`tm_mandala_<assetId>` and its lookup `ls_mandala_<assetId>`, the asset id
`<txid>_<vout>` (a Mandala token's `tm_mandala_<txid>_0`, its liveness topic
`tm_mandala_<txid>_0-live`); 0.7.2's `tm_<txid>_0` is no topic (no alias).
Registering a token is two engine calls, its topic then its lookup (the
Token topics page, `mandala/tokens/`, skein-mandala 0.9.0's); the lookup
answers BRC-207's `mandala-spendability` and `mandala-admission`. A Mandala
deploy's icon is embedded in it (BRC-162 draft bsv-blockchain/BRCs#308:
`[mediaType, bytes]`, the pointer forms gone): the Tokens page shows it and
the deploy form embeds it (no icon output). `ls_amm` keeps its index at
`amm/ls_amm` (skein-overlay 0.11.0: one index per lookup program). 0.7.2:
on skein-mandala 0.8.2, a token's topic was `tm_<tokenId>`, `_<vout>` always: a Mandala token's `tm_<txid>_0`, its
liveness topic `tm_<txid>_0-live`; the bare `tm_<txid>` is no topic
(David, 2026-10-08: "that was the decision all along"). 0.7.1: on
skein-overlay 0.10.0 and skein-mandala 0.8.1, every token id is `<txid>_<vout>`, Mandala and legacy
BSV-21 alike, `_0` included, as BRC-162 "Token identification" writes it
(David, 2026-10-07, shruggr/skein#120; supersedes 0.6.3's bare txid).
0.7.0: skein's routes, filters and roles
(shruggr/skein#143), on skein-overlay 0.10.0 and skein-mandala 0.8.0 — the
manifest's `dispatch` and `reads` are `routes` (no senders): the box
`amm/register` is root's (`roles: {root: ["register", "market",
"validator"]}`), the reads are read routes whose filters answer (the pages:
the filter `page`, amm-p2p's `serve`), `/call` lists `kernel.brc104`, and
the box `amm` is the engine's alone, so amm-p2p's message path moved to its
own box `amm/amm-p2p` (docs/AMM.md "Routes"). 0.6.3: the pages wrote a Mandala token's id as the bare
`<txid>` (superseded by 0.7.1), show outpoints as
`<txid>.<vout>`, let every id shown be expanded and copied, and send
`POST /submit` unsigned, with plain `fetch` (David, 2026-10-08). 0.6.2: market and validator are the owner's switch, both
off in the manifest (David, 2026-10-07: "this shouldn't have been a config
in the manifest. This should be a setting that the user is configuring";
"Use it", item 4). 0.6.1: `POST /submit` is BRC-22 again (it answers the
STEAK, and the pages read it; shruggr/skein#112). Market and validator are the engine's two settings
(0.6.0, shruggr/skein#120; David, 2026-10-06 evening: "a skein runs as a market and/or a validator by two settings in the engine's configuration (`config.overlay.market: {window}`, `config.overlay.validator: {every}`), and registering a token's topic is the one act that drives both"): with
`config.overlay.market` the engine's `register` asks the runtime's liveness
tool for the token's `tm_<txid>_0-live`, with `config.overlay.validator` it
beacons it, and amm-validator signs for every registered token; amm-p2p's
`validate` / `unvalidate`, its validated set, its beacons, its liveness and
its start / stop are gone. The listings, the documentation, the pages and
the token list (`/mandala/tokens`) are reads (0.5.0, shruggr/skein#135:
docs/AMM.md "Rows and reads"). The page reads `GET
<base>/.live/tm_<txid>_0-live`, plans over the pools whose validator is there
and names that validator (identity key and peer ID) in the swap, and the
relay dials the peer it is given — or, when it is its own node, hands the
request to its own validator program in-VM. Ported from amm-poc (b-open-io/amm-poc, its
`programs/`, `pool/` and `web/`) in 0.1.0 (shruggr/skein#120).
