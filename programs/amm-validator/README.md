# amm-validator

The AMM validator as a [skein](https://github.com/shruggr/skein) handler program (Zig 0.16.0, wasm32-wasi), the `amm-validator` program of the `amm` app (`etc/app.json`). Ported from amm-poc `programs/amm-validator` onto skein-overlay 0.6.0 and skein-1color 0.4.0 (below, "Port"), and in 0.2.0 onto skein-overlay 0.7.4 and skein-1color 0.5.0 (below, "0.2.0"). A taker (or the LP) builds, funds and signs the whole transaction and sends it to the validator in a **direct call** (what libp2p calls a stream). The validator checks it against the pool state and its policy, signs the pool input only with its rotating key, submits the signed transaction to its own overlay (the same submit `POST /submit` runs), and answers once that submission has been decided: the signed transaction, or the refusal (with the pool's newest state when it lost a race). The design notes are amm-poc's docs/notes.md, "Overlay and communication layer on skein (2026-09-29)" and the 2026-10-01 entries.

## 0.11.0: the affirmation; the validator's Close (David Case, 2026-10-21)

This section supersedes 0.9.0's deploy, filing and rescind below. Pool deploys move to the BRC-207 wallet module: the LP's wallet builds, signs and broadcasts the deploy as one action, so the validator cannot append to it, and the claim is gone.

- **Two calls**, `swap` (libp2p `/amm-validator/1/swap`, unchanged) and `affirm` (validator.zig `affirm`; no libp2p route: amm-p2p's `amm.pool.affirm` calls it in-VM with its package, box `affirm`, `transport: "local"`). `/amm-validator/1/deploy` and fn `deploy` are gone.
- **The affirmation** (docs/AMM.md "The deploy and the affirmation"): request `{pool: <the pool output's locking script, no payload>, satoshis, keyInput: "<txid>_<vout>"}`; checked: a pool (`not_a_pool`; `bad_pool` for a prefix that disagrees with the state), no payload yet (`bad_request`), our ValidatorIdentity (`not_our_pool`), its topic registered (`not_validating`), its fees our terms exactly (`fees_unacceptable`), positive reserves (`bad_request`), its ValidatorPubKey our child of `keyInput` and the signer's key (`wrong_validator_key`). Then the signer signs `pool.affirmDigest` (sha256 of the 221-byte message, src/pool.zig `affirmMessage`) with that key (`[1, "amm pool"]`, key ID `keyInput`, anyone) and answers at once `{ok: true, signature}`. Nothing is recorded or submitted.
- **The Close** (close.zig, main.zig `closeStep`; it replaces rescind.zig): root's `{fn: "close", args: {pool: "<txid>.<vout>"}}` in the box `amm/validator` (roles: root's `close`). `targetOf` follows `pool` (any of the pool's outputs) to its newest live output, ours; the wallet's `createAction` gets the pool as a caller input (`unlockingScriptLength` `maxUnlockLen`: the code, a 73-byte signature, bsvFee, a 20-byte change key hash, an 8-byte change, the preimage, the method), its transaction's BEEF, the contract's two outputs (`closeOutputs`: the pool's sats to P2PKH of the LP key, every token to it) and `noSend`; on the draft, `unlockClose` checks the outputs are the contract's then at most the wallet's one P2PKH change, and writes the Rúnar call `_codePart sig 0 _changePKH _changeAmount preimage 1` (`sig` the pool's current validator key's over the draft's BIP-143 preimage, ALL|FORKID; the key ID `validator.currentKeyId`'s); `signAction {reference, spends: {"<i>": {unlockingScript}}}`; the signed Close is submitted to this overlay for the token's topic and root is answered `{fn: "close", request, result | error}`.
- **Gone:** `deploy` (the delivered deploy, SIGHASH_SINGLE pairs, the unassigned unit, `claimedHeld`), the claim (`pool.claimDigest`, `claimScript`, `verifiedClaim`), filing.zig's `internalize` into `amm-claims` (launch.zig keeps the wallet launch), rescind.zig, and the reasons `not_paired`, `bad_sighash`, `unassigned_not_one`, `claim_unfunded`.

## 0.9.0: the deploy delivered and claimed; terms; the rescind (David Case, 2026-10-09)

- **Two calls**, `swap` and `deploy` (`/amm-validator/1/addLiquidity` is gone with the contract's AddLiquidity; `currentKeyId` no longer walks back through RemoveLiquidity: the key is the child of the first token input of the transaction that created the pool).
- **The terms** (`Config.terms`): `config.amm.ammValidator` `{lpFeeBps, validatorFeeBps, commissionBps}`, else genesis `defaults.ammValidator`, else 30, 5, 0. A deploy whose pool fields differ is refused `fees_unacceptable` (`detail`: `"<field>: the terms are <n>"`). Before 0.9.0 they were bounds (`minValidatorFeeBps`, `maxLpFeeBps`, `maxCommissionBps`).
- **The deploy** (validator.zig `deploy`): the LP's delivered deploy — every input signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|FORKID (`bad_sighash`), one output per input (`not_paired`), input 0 the first token input (`pool_not_first_token_input`), exactly one token unit unassigned (`unassigned_not_one`), the inputs covering the outputs and the claim's sat (`claim_unfunded`), then the checks as before (our pool, the topic, the pool checks, the key, the LP's signatures and parents). Then the claim (src/pool.zig): one unit of the token, P2PKH to the pool's validator key, its payload that key's DER signature through the signer over sha256(the pool's locking script ‖ the first token input's txid, internal order ‖ its vout, LE). The reply is the claimed deploy, `{ok: true, tx, txid}`; a retry finds it held (`claimedHeld`: a spender of the request's input 0 with its inputs and outputs and one more) and is routed again.
- **The filing** (filing.zig, main.zig): in the step that submits the claimed deploy, a thread of the genesis wallet program (`programs.wallet`) launched on `{body: {op: "internalize", tx: <Atomic BEEF>, outputs: [{outputIndex: <claim>, protocol: "basket insertion", insertionRemittance: {basket: "amm-claims", customInstructions, tags: ["amm-claim"]}}]}}`. Stepped with `resolved` (the wallet thread at rest) while the deploy is with the chain app, the handler waits on the deploy's submission thread.
- **The rescind** (rescind.zig, main.zig `rescindStep`): root's `{fn: "rescind", args: {pool: "<deploy txid>.0"}}` in the box `amm/validator` (roles: root's `rescind`). The claim (`claimOf`: our pool's verified claim) is the wallet's caller input (shruggr/skein#93): a wallet thread on `createAction` (the claim's outpoint and `unlockingScriptLength`, `inputBEEF` the deploy's BEEF from the chain state, one `OP_FALSE OP_RETURN`, `noSend`); its draft at rest, the claim input signed (`locate`, `unlockClaim`: P2PKH, ALL|FORKID, the pool's validator key through the signer) and a wallet thread on `signAction {reference, spends}`; signed, submitted to the overlay by message; the engine's answer answers root `{fn: "rescind", request, result | error}`. Tested natively with a mocked wallet: the fixture's `rescind`, byte for byte.

## 0.7.0: routes (shruggr/skein#143)

Unchanged code; the manifest's routes: libp2p `/amm-validator/1/swap`, `/addLiquidity`, `/deploy` → `amm-validator.swap`, `.addLiquidity`, `.deploy` (no filters, as the rows had none). The submission goes to box `<app>/submit`, whose route lists `kernel.beef` → `overlay.submit` (was the row `submit` from `*`, `filter: "beef"`). The validator role is root's switch (was the owner's), read the same way. No `owner` input was read.

## 0.6.0: the engine's validator setting and registered set gate every signature

**0.6.2** (skein-overlay 0.9.2; David, 2026-10-07: "this shouldn't have been a config in the manifest. This should be a setting that the user is configuring"): "`config.overlay.validator` is set" below reads "the validator role is on": the owner's switch kept in the registered set's record `<app>/topics` (`validator: {every} | {off: true}`, the engine's `validator` message in `<app>/register`) over `config.overlay.validator` (`main.zig` `validatedSet`: `topics.effective(topics.switchesOf(<the set's record>), config.rolesOf(in))`). The manifest sets neither role.

This section supersedes "0.3.2" below. David, 2026-10-06 evening (shruggr/skein#120): "The validator program signs for any registered token when `validator` is set." A `swap`, `addLiquidity` or `deploy` direct call (or the relay's local call) is answered only when the engine's `config.overlay.validator` is set (read from the step's input as the engine reads its configuration, skein-overlay 0.9.0 `config.rolesOf`) and the token's topic `tm_color_<txid>_0` is in the engine's registered set, the head `<app>/topics` (`main.zig` `validatedSet`, into `Config.validated`). Otherwise `{ok: false, reason: "not_validating", detail: "this validator does not validate tm_color_<txid>_0"}`, at the same point as before, nothing asked of the oracle, signed or submitted. The owner's `register` / `deregister` (box `<app>/register`, the engine's) are the only writers of the set; amm-p2p's validated set and `validate` / `unvalidate` are gone. A malformed `config.overlay.validator` fails the call (`BadRoles`).

## 0.4.0: called in-VM by this instance's own relay

When a taker names this node as the validator to its own relay (amm-p2p's `amm.*.submit` with `peerId` this node's), the relay cannot dial itself: its relay thread calls this program's fn (`swap`, `deploy`, `addLiquidity`) in-VM from its step, with the argument the front door gives a frame's handler — `{transport: "local", protocol, body: <the same signed package>, match: {program, fn, app}}`, plus `reply` / `resolved` when called again (amm-p2p `callValidator`). `directCall` takes `transport: "local"` beside `libp2p`; everything else is unchanged, and the `{wait: true}` and its `await` are the relay thread's.

## 0.3.2: the validated set gates every signature

"If I'm validating, I'm pinging, I'm taking on new liquidity, and I'm validating" (David 2026-10-06): one setting. A `swap`, `addLiquidity` or `deploy` direct call (the libp2p streams `/amm-validator/1/*`) is answered only for a token whose topic `tm_color_<txid>_0` is in amm-p2p's validated set — the `validated` of the record under the head `amm/p2p`, read at each call (`main.zig` `validatedSet`, into `Config.validated`). Otherwise `{ok: false, reason: "not_validating", detail: "this validator does not validate tm_color_<txid>_0"}`, before anything else is checked, the oracle is not asked and nothing is signed or submitted. For a spend the check comes right after the pool is found ours (check 2 below); for a deploy, right after its ValidatorIdentity is found ours, before the retry path. Taking on new liquidity means receiving it: signing an LP's `addLiquidity` and consenting to an LP's pool `deploy` as the pool's validator; the node's own funds are not involved. There is no setting of the validator's own: the owner's `validate` / `unvalidate` (box `amm/validate`, amm-p2p) are the only writers of the set. No head yet means nothing is validated: every call is refused.

## 0.2.1: the submissions box (skein-overlay 0.7.5)

The submission message goes to box `<app>/submit` (`submit.box`; the manifest's row `submit` from `*` → `overlay`, `filter: "beef"`): skein-overlay 0.7.5 takes `submit` in any box routed to the engine and `register` / `deregister` only in `<app>/register` (0.7.7; `<app>/overlay` before, shruggr/skein#128). The engine answers in the same box; the handler is called again with that `reply` as before.

## 0.2.0: submission by message (skein-overlay 0.7.4)

This section supersedes "A direct call, end to end" steps 4 to 6 where they differ. A submission is a message (skein-overlay 0.7.2+, docs/OVERLAY.md "Submitting"). After the checks and the signature, `messages.respond` looks at the state first: admitted under the topic, or rejected (a settlement) → answered from the state at once; with the chain app in a submission of its own (pending, not paused) → `await` that thread, `{wait: true}`, answered from the state when it rests (the engine answers a resubmission with nothing). Otherwise the handler sends `{fn: "submit", args: {beef: <the signed BEEF>, topics: ["tm_color_<txid>_0"]}}` from the instance to itself, box `amm` (the manifest's row from `$self` takes it to the engine), `await`s that message and answers `{wait: true}`. The engine answers the sender in the box it wrote to — `{fn: "submit", request, replyTo, result}` — and that answer calls the handler again with `reply`: `messages.answerFromSubmit` maps `admitted` / `proven` to the answer from the state (`{ok: true, tx, txid}`; a deploy's `{ok: true, txid}`), `rejected` to the state's `rejected` (with the pool's newest state) when the chain app holds it, else by the engine's reason (`NotAdmitted…` → `topic_refused`, `TransactionRejected` → `rejected`, any other → `submit_refused`), and an `error` answer to `submit_refused`. A BEEF lacking a parent is paused by the engine (every missing parent pauses since 0.7.2; a raw request is no longer refused `MissingInput` at once): the call waits until the parent comes.

## Port

What changed from amm-poc (skein-overlay 0.2.0, the wallet library's head `wallet`):

- **State.** The validator reads the app's overlay state (`<app>/state`, skein-overlay's `State`) over the chain app's (`chain/state`, read only), loaded as the engine loads them (`engine_vm.load`); amm-poc read the wallet library's chain + overlay core under the head `wallet`. `WalletView` is `OverlayView`.
- **Configuration.** The engine's configuration as the engine reads it (`engine_vm.configured`: the app record `<app>/app`, its `config.overlay`, the topics registered with the engine under `<app>/topics`, the app's roles); the validator's terms from `config.amm.ammValidator`, else genesis `defaults.ammValidator`.
- **The unproven parents.** amm-poc broadcast the taker's (or LP's) funding transaction itself, as a broadcast event, before the submission. Since skein #79 the chain app is the one broadcaster: the parent travels in the submission's BEEF, and the engine's ingest hands it to the chain app, which registers and broadcasts every unproven transaction the BEEF carries (shruggr/skein-chain docs/CHAIN.md "Ingest a BEEF"). `respond` still names them (`Served.broadcast`); nothing emits them.
- **The token library.** The parsers and rules are the `1color` module (skein-1color 0.4.0); the pool library is this repo's `src/pool.zig` (module `pool`); the topic's judgement in the tests is 1Color's `identify` (`color-topic`).
- **The signer.** Unchanged: the `wallet` import (BRC-100 wire frames, skein-sdk `wallet` module's `wire`).

## Layout

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `src/validator.zig` | The decisions: `spend` (swap), `affirm` (0.11.0: a proposed pool, signed), the newest-state walk, the current-key walk, `signedSpend` (finding a request's signed transaction again). Pure. |
| `src/close.zig` | The validator's Close (0.11.0): the target, the wallet's createAction and signAction bodies, the pool input's Rúnar call over the draft. Pure. |
| `src/launch.zig` | Launching the genesis wallet program on a request. |
| `src/unlock.zig` | The pool call as Rúnar lays it out, the BIP-143 preimage, slot replacement, P2PKH signature checks (bsvz). |
| `src/messages.zig` | The protocol: the direct call's package (`open`), request parsing, reply encoding, `respond` (the checks, then skein's route: what the handler does next) and `answerFromState` (the answer after the submission's thread rests). |
| `src/view.zig` | What the validator reads of its overlay (`View`), and `OverlayView` over the app's overlay state and the chain state. |
| `src/oracle.zig` | The validator's keys through the signer, the `wallet` import (BRC-100 wire frames, skein-sdk `wallet` module's `wire`). |
| `src/submit.zig` | `Route` (the engine's own `submit.route` in the handler's step), `submissionBeef` (the signed BEEF). |
| `src/main.zig` | The VM adapter: the handlers (fn `swap`, `affirm`), launching or awaiting the submission's thread, root's `close` and its thread's steps, and `main`. |
| `../../src/fixtures/add_liquidity.zig` | Generated: an AddLiquidity continuing the fixture chain; the funded AddLiquidity of the fixture pool with its nosend funding transaction (the relay's shape). |
| `../../gen/addliquidity/main.go` | Its generator (Go, this repo's module). |
| `test.zig` | Tests. |

Dependencies (`build.zig`): skein-overlay 0.6.0 by URL + hash (the `topic` and `sk` modules, and its engine sources `state.zig`, `submit.zig`, `calls.zig`, `config.zig`, `engine_vm.zig` as one module `skein_overlay`, which it does not export: the validator submits through the engine's own `submit.route`, as amm-poc did); skein-sdk through it (`chain`, `wallet`, `message`, `cbor`); skein-1color 0.4.0 (`1color`); and `pool` (`src/pool.zig`).

## Routes

The app asks for three `libp2p` dispatch rows (skein docs/APPS.md §2: `{transport: "libp2p", address: "/amm-validator/1/<call>", sender: "*", program: "amm-validator", fn}`; protocols are global, not namespaced under `/amm/`). Nothing in the program names a path or a protocol: the row's `fn` says which call it is. The validator advances no head (it launches the engine's submission thread, which writes under the app's name).

| route | fn |
|---|---|
| `libp2p:/amm-validator/1/swap` | `swap` |

(0.9.0: `/addLiquidity` gone; 0.11.0: `/deploy` gone. fn `affirm` has no route: amm-p2p calls it in-VM.) No HTTP route; one mailbox route, the box `amm/validator` (root's `close`, and its thread's steps).

## A direct call, end to end

Under skein's current contracts (docs/MESSAGES.md "libp2p (#51)", "Route handlers: the program-facing contract (#68, #66)", "A synchronous client waits on the thread (#66)"; docs/OVERLAY.md "Admitted into the graph, then broadcast (#57)", "The answer"):

1. The taker dials the validator's peer and writes one frame on `/amm-validator/1/<call>`. The host appends it as a `p2p-frame` request and steps the front door on it; the front door calls the route's fn with `arg = {transport: "libp2p", protocol, from, key, body, request, …}`.
2. **The package.** The frame's body is a signed-message package `{message, body}`, the shape skein reads on `/skein/message/1.0.0` (MESSAGES.md "Signed messages (#70)"): a mail record signed by the taker's wallet identity (BRC-169's signature: its anyone-child for `[2, "metanet handles envelope"]`, key ID `send`) whose `recipient` is the validator's identity key (the pool's ValidatorIdentity) and whose `box` is the call (`swap`, `addLiquidity`, `deploy`), and the request body it names. `messages.open` checks it with skein-sdk's `message.problem`; anything else is refused `unauthenticated`. This is the role BRC-103 played.
3. **The checks and the signature** ("What is checked"). A refusal is answered at once: `{verdict: "accept", body: <reply>}`. A deploy is not signed: on consent the LP's deploy goes on to the submission as it came.
4. **The submission.** The signed BEEF (a deploy's: the request's BEEF as it came) goes through the engine's own `submit.route` (skein-overlay src/submit.zig) for the token's topic `tm_color_<txid>_0` (a topic the owner registered with the engine), in the front door's step: decoded into the step's write cache, checked against the chain app's headers, judged by the topic's program (`color-topic`). What it makes is what the overlay's own `/submit` handler acts on, and the validator acts the same way (routes.zig `submitRouted`):
   - the submit event → **launch** the overlay engine (the app's `programs.overlay`) on it, args `{event: <the record>, box: "submit"}` — the submission's thread — and answer `{wait: true}`;
   - `pending` (the same transaction already awaits the chain app: a resubmission) → `await` that thread (the overlay's `pending` record names it) and answer `{wait: true}`; if it is already at rest, answer from the state;
   - `unchanged` (judged before) → answer from the state at once;
   - `nothing` / `refused` → `rejected` / `topic_refused` / `submit_refused`, at once.
5. **The gate.** The engine hands the BEEF to the chain app (`ingest`), which registers and broadcasts every unproven transaction in it, parents first, and admits on the chain app's first `accepted` or `proven`; `rejected` rejects it. Admitted or rejected, the submission's thread finishes.
6. **The answer.** The frame's thread was waiting on it: the front door calls the handler again with the same request plus `resolved`, and `messages.answerFromState` reads the state — it finds the signed transaction among the held spenders of the pool (whatever their settlement) and answers `{verdict: "accept", body}`:
   - admitted (the topic's `applied` record) → `{ok: true, tx, txid}`;
   - rejected → `{ok: false, reason: "rejected", detail, txid, pool?}` (`pool` when another transaction spent the pool meanwhile);
   - still pending (the thread errored before the gate decided) → `{ok: false, reason: "pending", txid}`: send the same request again;
   - not held → `{ok: false, reason: "submit_failed"}`.

   The front door writes that body back on the stream: "a frame's handler may wait on a thread as an HTTP route's may (`{wait: true}`); the frame's answer is written back when the request's thread comes to rest".

Once admitted, publishing the transaction on the topic's pubsub side is the overlay engine's, not this program's (docs/notes.md 2026-10-01, "Publishing is part of submit"; skein #74).

## Protocol

Bodies are dag-cbor. An outpoint is text, BRC-162's form: `<txid, 64 hex, display order>_<vout>`.

**`swap`** and **`addLiquidity`**

```
request  {tx: bytes, pool: "<txid>_<vout>"}
reply    {ok: true, tx: bytes, txid: "<hex>"}           admitted in the validator's overlay
         {ok: false, reason, detail?, txid?, pool?}
```

- `tx` is the complete transaction, funded and signed by the taker (LP) on its own inputs, with the validator's signature slot in the pool call left as `OP_0`. It may be raw bytes, or a BEEF (V1, V2, Atomic) whose subject it is: its ancestry travels with the submission. Send a BEEF: a raw request is submitted as a V1 BEEF of the signed transaction alone, which verifies only if the instance holds every parent (`submit_refused`, `MissingInput`, otherwise).
- **An unproven parent** (amm-poc docs/notes.md 2026-10-02, "Swap funding and signing"): the BEEF may carry the taker's nosend funding transaction unproven, the swap spending its output — the form the marketplace relay sends (amm-p2p README, "The marketplace relay": one BEEF, the funding transaction's ancestry, the funding transaction, the swap). Every unproven transaction in the request's BEEF that is the swap's ancestry and that this instance does not hold must be complete (check 8). It travels in the submission's BEEF (the request's, its subject replaced by the signed swap), and the chain app registers and broadcasts it, parents first, when the engine ingests the submission (amm-poc broadcast it from the validator; since skein #79 the chain app is the one broadcaster). On any refusal nothing is submitted.
- The reply's `tx` is the same transaction with the validator's signature in its slot (the STEAK is the overlay's; the validator answers with the transaction).
- `txid` in a refusal: the signed transaction's, when the refusal is about it (after signing).
- `pool` in a refusal: when the pool was already spent (`pool_spent`, or `rejected` when another transaction spent it meanwhile), its newest state, followed from spender to spender (continuations are always output 0): `{outpoint, bsvReserve, tokenReserve, lpFeeBps, validatorFeeBps, commissionBps, tokenId, lpPubKey, validatorPubKey, validatorIdentity}`, or `{closed: true, outpoint, closedBy}`. A spender awaiting the network counts (the instance holds it).
- **The same request again** is recognised: the pool's spender is this request with the validator's signature in it, so it is not signed again; it waits on the first submission's thread, or is answered from the state.

**`affirm`** (0.11.0)

```
request  {pool: bytes, satoshis: uint, keyInput: "<txid>_<vout>"}
reply    {ok: true, signature: bytes}                    the ValidatorPubKey's DER signature of the affirmation
         {ok: false, reason, detail?}
```

`pool` is the pool output's locking script as the deploy will carry it, without the payload; `satoshis` its BSV reserve; `keyInput` the deploy's first token input. Answered at once ("What is checked"); nothing is submitted. The deploy's pool output carries `signature` as its BRC-162 payload (docs/AMM.md "The deploy and the affirmation").

**Close** is the LP's (no validator call), or the validator's own by root's message (0.11.0, above).

**Reasons:** `bad_request`, `bad_transaction`, `pool_not_an_input`, `unknown_pool`, `pool_spent`, `not_a_pool`, `not_our_pool`, `wrong_method`, `bad_call`, `signature_slot_not_empty`, `wrong_next_key`, `topic_refused` (detail: `inflation`, or the route's reason), `bad_pool` (detail: the pool violation), `pool_not_first_token_input`, `preimage_mismatch`, `missing_signature`, `bad_signature` (detail: which input), `policy`, `current_key_unknown`, `oracle_failed`, `unauthenticated` (detail: why the package does not hold), `submit_failed`, `submit_refused` (detail: skein's route's reason, e.g. `MissingInput`), `pending`, `rejected` (detail: the settlement's reason, e.g. `REJECTED`), `pool_not_at_output_0`, `fees_unacceptable` (detail: which rate), `wrong_validator_key`, `bad_outputs` (detail: which output; a Swap's or an AddLiquidity's), `not_validating` (0.3.2; detail: the topic).

## What is checked

A spend (`validator.zig` `spend`, in order; nothing is signed on any refusal):

1. The transaction parses and spends the named pool.
2. The pool is an output the instance's overlay holds, it is the Pool code, and its ValidatorIdentity is this instance's identity key (`self.identity`, else the oracle's root): else `not_our_pool`. Its token topic is in the validated set (0.3.2): else `not_validating`.
3. It is still live in the topic. If a held transaction spent it: `pool_spent` with the newest state — unless that transaction is this request, signed (a retry).
4. The pool input calls the call's method (Rúnar's method index), laid out as Rúnar calls it, its code push is the pool's code, and the validator's slot is `OP_0`.
5. The next validator key, in the call's argument and in the continuation's state, is the child of the spent pool outpoint.
6. The topic would admit the transaction (1Color's `token.judge`: the BSV-21 rules alone, the previous coins as the overlay has them, the inputs' sources held or from the request's BEEF); the pool checks pass (`pool.check`: output 0, prefix agrees with code and state; the topic `tm_color_<txid>_0` no longer runs them, so a malformed continuation is a valid token output there, and the validator refuses to sign it, `bad_pool`); and the pool is the first token input. `pool.check` does not look at the ValidatorPubKey (decided 2026-10-01: the overlay treats a pool with any validator key as a pool); the validator checks its own key itself, steps 5 and 10. For a Swap (`Swap(validatorSig, nextValidatorPubKey, amountIn, bsvIn, userPkh, commissionPkh)`), the output set is the contract's (`validator.swapOutputs`, over `pool.quoteSwap` and `pool.payoutScript`): output 0 the continuation holding the new reserves, 1 the payout to userPkh in the other asset, then the LP fee, the validator fee and the commission (CommissionBps of amountIn, rounded up, to the call's commissionPkh), each in the input asset (sats, or a 1-sat BRC-162 value output) and only when nonzero, then Rúnar's change output (P2PKH to `_changePKH`) only when `_changeAmount > 0`, and nothing else: else `bad_outputs` (detail: which). For an AddLiquidity (`AddLiquidity(lpSig, validatorSig, nextLpPubKey, nextValidatorPubKey, addBsv, addTokens)`, `validator.addLiquidityOutputs`): output 0 the continuation with the pool's code and readonly fields, satoshis the pool's + addBsv, TokenReserve the pool's + addTokens, LpPubKey the call's nextLpPubKey (the ValidatorPubKey is check 5's), then Rúnar's change output only when `_changeAmount > 0`, and nothing else (the contract has no fee and no commission on AddLiquidity): else `bad_outputs`. The contract commits to the same set; this refuses before signing, with the reason.
7. The preimage the call pushes is this input's (BIP-143, ALL|FORKID, the scriptCode after Rúnar's `OP_NOP OP_CODESEPARATOR`).
8. Every other input carries a signature; a P2PKH input (plain or under a token prefix) whose source is known is verified in full. For AddLiquidity, the LP's signature in the pool call is verified against LpPubKey. Every unproven parent the request's BEEF carries (the swap's ancestry, not held here: the taker's funding transaction) is complete: each of its inputs signed, verified in full the same way where its source is known (in the BEEF, or held) — else `missing_signature` / `bad_signature` with detail `parent <txid> input <n>`.
10. The current key: its key ID is the outpoint of the last input the validator signed (the first token input of the transaction that created the pool, walked back through LP-only RemoveLiquidity spends), checked against the pool's ValidatorPubKey by public derivation.

Then the preimage's sha256d is signed through the oracle (`createSignature`, BRC-43 level 1, protocol `amm pool`, key ID `<txid>_<vout>`, counterparty `anyone`: invoice `1-amm pool-<txid>_<vout>`, `hashToDirectlySign`), checked against ValidatorPubKey, and put in its slot as `<DER ‖ 0x41>`.

An affirm (`validator.zig` `affirm`, 0.11.0): the script is a 1Color value output whose lock is the Pool code (`not_a_pool`), with no payload (`bad_request`), its prefix id and amount the asset id and TokenReserve the code and state carry (`bad_pool`); its ValidatorIdentity is ours (`not_our_pool`); its token topic is in the validated set (`not_validating`); its fees are the terms exactly (`fees_unacceptable`, detail `"<field>: the terms are <n>"`); its satoshis and TokenReserve are positive (`bad_request`); its ValidatorPubKey is our child of `keyInput`, by public derivation and as the signer's `getPublicKey` (forSelf) (`wrong_validator_key`). Then the signer signs the affirmation digest with that key; the signature is checked against the pool before it is answered (`oracle_failed`).

## Configuration

The app record's `config.amm.ammValidator`: the terms `{"lpFeeBps": n, "validatorFeeBps": n, "commissionBps": n}` (0.9.0; else 30, 5, 0), else genesis `defaults.ammValidator` (the same as JSON text). The engine's configuration as the engine reads it: the served topics (`config.overlay.topics` and the topics registered with the engine; the route judges `tm_color_<txid>_0` with the program registered for it), the app's `programs.overlay` (the engine the submission thread runs). The app must serve the token's topic: the owner registers `tm_color_<txid>_0` with the engine first (`{fn: "register", args: {topic, program: "color-topic"}}`, README "Use").

## Tests and fixtures

`test.zig` runs the validator over a mock overlay (`MemView`: the fixture chain, admitted by `token.judge`), a mock signer (a root key answering the wire frames), and, for the submission, a real node (`Node`, `Mined`): skein-overlay's `State` over skein-sdk's chain `State` on a `MemStore`, the engine's own `submit.route` and the submission thread's steps (`submit.begin`, `submit.answered`), the topic's judgement behind the topic contract (1Color's `identify`), and the chain app stood in for by the chain state itself (what it records, registers and broadcasts on `ingest`). The Go fixtures are mined there (block 1: fund, token_deploy, pool_deploy, each proven by a BUMP); the node takes token_deploy and pool_deploy through the overlay's submit and never sees fund.

- **The package:** a taker-signed package opens to its sender and body; another recipient, another call, a bare body, garbage, and a body the message does not name are refused `unauthenticated`.
- **Signing, byte for byte:** sats-in swap, tokens-in swap, AddLiquidity after a RemoveLiquidity (the current-key walk). The mock oracle answers the fixture's recorded signature for that digest only if it verifies under the key the frame's key ID derives.
- **Submission:** the sats-in swap as a BEEF carrying fund: signed, routed, the submit record to launch on; the engine's step broadcasts and leaves it pending; the status provider's RECEIVED admits it (continuation and payout); `answerFromState` answers the signed transaction. A raw request is refused `submit_refused` after the checks. A rejection: `rejected`, and the same request again is refused at once. A resubmission while pending is not re-signed and waits on the thread the broadcast record names; once admitted the answer is the transaction, and a later resend is answered from the state.
- **The relay's request** (a pair derived from the fixtures, built in the test: a funding transaction spending fund:1 and paying the swap's input exactly, signed by the fixtures' taker; `swap_bsv_in` re-spending it with its contract outputs (the commission at 4 to the fixtures' relay), no change, the pool call's preimage recomputed, the validator's slot empty): one BEEF (fund proven, the funding transaction unproven, the swap) is checked, signed last (the signed swap is the request but for the slot; the taker's signature still verifies; one oracle call), routed through skein's submit (the pool contract and both P2PKH spends run in its SPV), the funding transaction handed back to broadcast with its Atomic BEEF while the engine broadcasts only the swap, and admitted; sent again, answered from the state with nothing to broadcast. Refused with nothing signed or to broadcast: the funding input unsigned (`missing_signature`, `parent …`), its signature bad (`bad_signature`), the pool already spent (`pool_spent`).
- **Refusals:** not our pool, not a pool input, unknown pool, wrong method, slot not empty, bad transaction, inflation, the wrong next key, missing and bad signatures, a foreign preimage, the pool already spent (with its newest state); a swap's outputs not the contract's (`bad_outputs`: the call naming another commissionPkh, output 4 paying another, no commission output, the commission or the LP fee a sat short, an output past the change).
- **Affirm** (0.11.0): the fixture pool as proposed (`pool_deploy_unaffirmed`'s output 0, its sats, token_deploy:0) is affirmed with gen/vectors' signature byte for byte (the mock signer answers the recorded one), and the deploy's pool output is that script with it as the payload; refused with nothing signed: each fee off the terms, another identity, a key not our child of `keyInput` (the signer asked only for the key), a script with a payload already, a token payout, garbage, a prefix amount off the state, no sats; out of the validated set, `not_validating`.
- **Close** (0.11.0, a mocked wallet): from the deploy's outpoint to the newest pool output (`swap_tokens_in:0`); the createAction body (the pool a caller input, its length the bound, the contract's two outputs, the LP's as on its own Close, noSend); the draft's pool input written and signed — gen/vectors' `close_validator` byte for byte (the unlocking script, then the whole signed transaction); the topic admits it (the pool spent, the LP's tokens admitted); a reordered draft refused; a closed pool, another identity, an outpoint not held refused.
- **Protocol:** outpoint text, request parsing, bad requests, reply encoding.

Regenerate the AddLiquidity fixtures after the vectors, from the repo root: `go run ./gen/addliquidity` (`add_liquidity`: after a removal, with change; `add_funding` + `add_liquidity_funded`: the funded variant the relay carries).

## Deferred and open

- **Run end to end.** amm-poc ran the `swap`, `deploy` and `addLiquidity` frame paths on its deploy (amm-poc deploy/README.md "The relay round trip"). This port is tested natively only; it has not been installed.
- **A deploy's token inputs must be admitted coins in this overlay.** The topic's judgement (`token.judge`) counts a token input only when the overlay holds it as an admitted, unspent coin (`previousCoins`); the request's BEEF supplies the sources' scripts, not their admission. A deploy spending token outputs this instance's overlay has not admitted (tokens the overlay never saw) is refused `topic_refused` (detail `inflation`: the pool's tokens come from nowhere, as the topic sees it); tested natively (the fixture pool deploy against an overlay that never took token_deploy, token_deploy in the BEEF). The live run spends a token output both overlays admitted.
- **The package on an app protocol.** skein's front door reads and verifies signed-message packages only on `/skein/message/1.0.0`, and admits them as mail (answered by a message, not on the stream). On the validator's own protocols the frame is unsigned and `from` is the remote peer, so the handler verifies the package itself with the SDK's verifier. Replay of a package is harmless here (a retry is recognised), but the front door keeps no nonce for it.
- **No slippage or expiry policy** (David, 2026-10-02): the contract is fixed, so the swapper's client is the only party that handles slippage; a stale pool is refused `pool_spent` with the current state and the client replans; expiry is the relay record's. **Low-S:** the oracle's signature is checked for validity, not for low-S.
- **A pending spend blocks the pool:** another taker's request against it is refused `pool_spent` with the pending continuation, which may yet be rejected.
- **The thread that rests pending:** under #66 the submission's thread rests only when admitted or rejected (or errored); the host's own bound (`answerWaitMs`) is an HTTP client's 503, and what a stream's waiting frame gets past that bound is not specified.
