//! One swap in flight per pool (0.43.0, agent-env plans/pool-lock-build-2026-11-06.md D3; David
//! Case 2026-11-06: "That seems the logical approach to me"). On ovh two swaps on one NANNER pool
//! were signed seconds apart, both submitted before the chain app held either, both held, neither
//! applied (plans/double-spender-audit-2026-11-06.md). The validator now signs one spend of a pool
//! at a time.
//!
//! **The lock.** When `spend` signs and the signed transaction goes to this instance's overlay
//! (messages.zig `Next.submit`), its pool is locked in the same step: the record names the pool
//! output the transaction spends (the key), its txid, the thread of the step that signed (the
//! direct call's request thread, or the local relay's thread: what a waiter awaits) and the
//! request's hash (sha256 of the transaction as sent, the validator's slot empty). The lock is
//! released in that thread's step that takes the submission's answer (admitted or rejected), and
//! a lock whose thread has come to rest without one (its own bound: the local relay's deadline)
//! holds nothing: awaiting a thread at rest is refused (skein docs/VM.md, "Waiting on a thread"),
//! which is how a lock is found stale.
//!
//! **A request for a locked pool** — whatever output of the pool it names: the lineage is walked
//! forward from it, spender to spender (`validator.newest`'s walk), to the output the lock is
//! keyed at — is not refused and not signed: it awaits the holder's thread (answer `{wait:
//! true}`) and joins the lock's queue. Stepped again when that thread comes to rest (`resolved`),
//! it runs the same check again (`gate`, then `spend`): the transaction admitted → the pool is
//! spent, the existing `pool_spent` answer with the new state; rejected → the first of the queue
//! is checked and signed and takes the lock, the rest wait on it. Locks are per pool.
//!
//! **Order.** The kernel steps the threads awaiting one thread in the order of its `awaits` map:
//! the awaiting thread's origin `at` (its request's stamp, in ms), then the origin's CID — arrival
//! order to the millisecond, not within one. So the queue keeps arrival order itself: a waiter
//! stepped while an earlier waiter of the queue still waits awaits that one instead.
//!
//! The record, the root of the head `<app>/locks`:
//!
//!   {kind: "amm-pool-locks", locks: [{pool: "<txid>_<vout>", txid?: "<hex>", thread?: <cid>,
//!     request?: bytes(32), waiters: [<cid>]}]}
//!
//! `txid`, `thread`, `request` together (the holder), or none (a queue whose holder came to rest).
