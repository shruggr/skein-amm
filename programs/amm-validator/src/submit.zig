//! Getting a signed transaction into this instance's own overlay: the
//! validator only adds its signature; the submission is the overlay engine's
//! (skein-overlay 0.7.4 docs/OVERLAY.md "Submitting", shruggr/skein#112). A
//! submission is a message: the validator sends `{fn: "submit", args: {beef,
//! topics: [tm_<txid>]}}` from this instance to itself, in the app's box
//! `<app>` (the manifest's row from `$self` takes it to the engine), with the
//! signed BEEF — the request's BEEF (the taker's ancestry and BUMPs) with its
//! subject replaced by the signed transaction (`submissionBeef`). The engine
//! routes it in its step on the message (decoded, checked against the chain
//! app's headers and SPV, judged by the topic's program; lacking a parent,
//! paused until one comes) and answers the sender, in the box it wrote to,
//! by message: `{fn: "submit", request, replyTo, result}` — `admitted`
//! (status `pending`, the STEAK) once the chain app accepts it, then each
//! `proven`, or `rejected` — or `error` for a body not that shape.
//!
//! main.zig awaits the message and answers the direct call `{wait: true}`;
//! called again with the engine's first answer (`reply`), it answers from
//! that (messages.zig `answerFromSubmit`).
