    \\
    \\The listed pools of the AMM's Pool contract, over every 1Color token topic this
    \\overlay serves (`tm_color_<txid>_<vout>`). A pool is a BRC-162 value output at output 0 whose
    \\lock is the compiled Pool code followed by its state, its prefix agreeing with the asset id and
    \\the TokenReserve its code and state carry. A pool is listed when it attests itself: its
    \\ValidatorPubKey is the ValidatorIdentity's child keyed by the Nonce in its state (derived by
    \\this lookup), and the Affirmation in its state is that key's signature of the pool's
    \\parameters. A Swap's continuation of a listed pool is listed when its ValidatorPubKey is the
    \\identity's child keyed by the spent pool outpoint. The LP's Close and the validator's Rescind
    \\(which clears the ValidatorPubKey) end the listing.
    \\
    \\Every query names its token, `tokenId` (`<txid>`, `<txid>_<vout>` or `<txid>.<vout>`,
    \\the deploy outpoint):
    \\
    \\- `{tokenId}`: every live pool of the token, as
    \\  `{outpoint, bsvReserve, tokenReserve, liquidityFeeBps, validationFeeBps,
    \\  commissionBps, validatorIdentityKey, lastSeen?}` (freeform);
    \\- `{tokenId, outpoint}`: that pool, or its newest continuation,
    \\  `{current, hops}` (freeform); with `beef: true`, the pool output and its
    \\  transaction's BEEF (output-list);
    \\- `{tokenId, validatorIdentityKey}`: that validator's listed pools of the token.
    \\
    \\Its beat on `ls_amm_<assetId>-live` (dag-cbor): `{tokens: {<assetId>: {<validator identity>: {sats, tokens,
    \\pools}}}}`, this overlay's listed pools summed per token and validator: the prices.
