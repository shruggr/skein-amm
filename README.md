# skein-amm

A non-custodial BSV ↔ token AMM over Mandala tokens (BRC-162), as one
[skein](https://github.com/shruggr/skein) overlay app, name `amm`. Its tree
carries the overlay engine, the Mandala components, the AMM's own programs
and its pages. Version **0.6.2**: on skein-overlay 0.9.2 (skein-sdk 0.7.1)
and skein-mandala 0.7.3; market and validator are the owner's switch, both
off in the manifest (David, 2026-10-07: "this shouldn't have been a config
in the manifest. This should be a setting that the user is configuring";
"Use it", item 4). 0.6.1: `POST /submit` is BRC-22 again (it answers the
STEAK, and the pages read it; shruggr/skein#112). Market and validator are the engine's two settings
(0.6.0, shruggr/skein#120; David, 2026-10-06 evening: "a skein runs as a market and/or a validator by two settings in the engine's configuration (`config.overlay.market: {window}`, `config.overlay.validator: {every}`), and registering a token's topic is the one act that drives both"): with
`config.overlay.market` the engine's `register` asks the runtime's liveness
tool for the token's `tm_<txid>-live`, with `config.overlay.validator` it
beacons it, and amm-validator signs for every registered token; amm-p2p's
`validate` / `unvalidate`, its validated set, its beacons, its liveness and
its start / stop are gone. The listings, the documentation, the pages and
the token list (`/mandala/tokens`) are reads (0.5.0, shruggr/skein#135:
docs/AMM.md "Rows and reads"). The page reads `GET
<base>/.live/tm_<txid>-live`, plans over the pools whose validator is there
and names that validator (identity key and peer ID) in the swap, and the
relay dials the peer it is given — or, when it is its own node, hands the
request to its own validator program in-VM. Ported from amm-poc (b-open-io/amm-poc, its
`programs/`, `pool/` and `web/`) in 0.1.0 (shruggr/skein#120).

## What it is

| role | file | what |
|---|---|---|
| `overlay` | `bin/overlay.wasm` | the overlay engine, skein-overlay 0.9.2's build: serves the topics, keeps the registered set (`register` / `deregister`, only in `amm/register`) and, by the owner's `market` / `validator` switch (0.9.2; the initial value `config.overlay.market` / `.validator`, absent here), asks liveness of and beacons each registered token's `tm_<txid>-live`, takes submissions by message (box `amm/submit`, answered to the sender's box) and by `POST /submit` (BRC-22: the STEAK) |
| `mandala-topic` | `bin/mandala-topic.wasm` | skein-mandala 0.7.3's topic manager: one topic per token, `tm_<txid>`, judged by the BRC-162 rules alone; the discovery topic `tm_mandala` |
| `mandala-lookup` | `bin/mandala-lookup.wasm` | skein-mandala 0.7.3's lookups `ls_mandala` (a token's value and authority outputs, one output) and `ls_mandala_deploys` (a token's deploy output), and the token list (the read `/mandala/tokens`) |
| `amm-lookup` | `programs/amm-lookup` | `ls_amm`: the live pools of every token topic the overlay serves, each query naming its token |
| `amm-validator` | `programs/amm-validator` | the validator, for every registered token when `config.overlay.validator` is set: checks a taker's or an LP's transaction against the pool, signs the pool input last, submits it to its own overlay by message and answers on the engine's answer (`swap`, `addLiquidity`, `deploy`, libp2p direct calls) |
| `amm-p2p` | `programs/amm-p2p` | the marketplace relay (`amm.swap/1`, `amm.pool/1`, `amm.liquidity/1`: a transaction carried to the validator the caller names), and the pages (`www/`, served from the app's own tree) |
| | `src/pool.zig` | the Pool contract as the overlay sees it: recognising a pool, its state, the pool checks (module `pool`, over the `mandala` parser) |
| | `pool/` | the Rúnar contract (`Pool.runar.go`) and its Go tests |
| | `gen/` | the fixture generators (`src/fixtures/`) |
| | `web/ui`, `web/engine` | the pages (validator, LP, swap, tokens) and the matching engine, built into `www/` |
| | `www/mandala/` | skein-mandala 0.7.3's pages: deploy a token, the owner's token topics |

docs/AMM.md has the pieces, the pool rule, the interfaces, the rows and
what is not wired.

## Build

Zig 0.16.0 (`mise.toml`), Go 1.27 for `pool/` and `gen/`, Node 22 or later
and npm for the pages.

```
zig build test     # the pool library and the three programs, natively
zig build bin      # bin/: this repo's three programs, built; overlay.wasm and mandala-*.wasm, copied
go test ./pool/...
scripts/www.sh     # www/: the pages from web/ui, then the Mandala pages into www/mandala/
```

**The overlay and Mandala artifacts are fetched, not built here.**
`build.zig.zon` names skein-overlay v0.9.2 and skein-mandala v0.7.3 by tag
URL and hash; `zig build bin` copies `bin/overlay.wasm` from the
skein-overlay package and `bin/mandala-topic.wasm`, `bin/mandala-lookup.wasm`
from the skein-mandala package, byte for byte. skein-mandala's pages are
outside its package's `paths`, so `scripts/mandala-pages.sh` fetches the same
tag's tarball by URL and checks its sha256 before copying its `www/` into
`www/mandala/`. `bin/` and `www/` are committed: what a skein installs is the
finished tree, and nothing is built on the skein.

The pages need two local checkouts (web/ui/README.md): Rúnar at
`~/Work/bsv/runar` (`RUNAR_DIR`; d207ee8e, the commit go.mod pins) and
1sat-sdk at `~/Work/bsv/1sat-sdk` (`ONESAT_SDK_DIR`; master 183c0ce3), whose
sources are bundled. Their tests:

```
cd web/engine && npm ci && npm test
cd web/ui && npm ci && npm test && npm run typecheck
```

Regenerate the fixtures after changing `pool/Pool.runar.go`, from the repo
root: `go run ./gen/vectors`, then `go run ./gen/addliquidity`.

## Use

The base URL of the app is `https://<handle>.<host>/amm` (on a host without
wildcard DNS, `<host>/@<handle>/amm`).

1. **Install the chain app, then the AMM**, as the owner (skein docs/APPS.md
   §3: the management page, or `skein plan install` and `skein send`):

   ```
   skein plan install https://github.com/shruggr/skein-chain#<commit> --origin <instance> --out chain/ && skein send <instance> chain/
   skein plan install https://github.com/shruggr/skein-amm#<commit> --origin <instance> --out amm/ && skein send <instance> amm/
   ```

2. **Deploy a token** at `<base>/mandala/deploy/` (anyone, with their own
   wallet). The page shows the token's topic, `tm_<txid>`.
3. **Register its topic** at `<base>/mandala/tokens/` (the owner). The page
   sends the owner's message to the app's box `register` (`amm/register`,
   shruggr/skein#128), which the row `{address: "register", sender: "$owner",
   program: "overlay"}` takes to the engine:

   ```
   box:  amm/register
   body: {"fn": "register", "args": {"topic": "tm_<txid>", "program": "mandala-topic"}}
   body: {"fn": "deregister", "args": {"topic": "tm_<txid>"}}
   ```

   `tm_mandala` (the discovery topic) is registered the same way.
4. **Market and validator** (0.6.0, shruggr/skein#120, David 2026-10-06
   evening; 0.6.2, David 2026-10-07: "this shouldn't have been a config in
   the manifest. This should be a setting that the user is configuring"):
   two roles of the engine, both **off** as installed — this manifest sets
   neither. The owner turns a role on (or off) one of two ways, with no
   reinstall needed for the second:

   - **At install**, `--config` (merged over the manifest's `config`, one
     level deep per program, so the lookups stay):

     ```
     skein plan install <repo-url#commit> --origin <instance> \
       --config '{"overlay": {"market": {"window": 40000}, "validator": {"every": 30000}}}' --out plan
     ```

     That is the initial value.
   - **Later, by the switches** on the Token topics page
     (`<base>/mandala/tokens/`, skein-mandala 0.7.3: Market and Validator),
     each an owner's message to the engine in the same box as register:

     ```
     box:  amm/register
     body: {"fn": "market", "args": {"window": 40000}}     |  {"fn": "market", "args": {"off": true}}
     body: {"fn": "validator", "args": {"every": 30000}}   |  {"fn": "validator", "args": {"off": true}}
     ```

     The answer is the roles in effect, `{market?: {window}, validator?:
     {every}}`. The switch is kept beside the registered set in `amm/topics`
     and has precedence over `--config`'s value from then on (skein-overlay
     0.9.2). Turning a role on emits its liveness / beacon for every token
     already registered; off ends them.

   The register above is the one act that drives both, for the roles in
   effect. With `market`, the
   engine's `register` also emits `{event: "liveness", topic:
   "tm_<txid>-live", window}`: the runtime's liveness tool subscribes the
   topic without admitting its messages, verifies each beat and keeps the
   ones within the window in memory, served at `GET
   <base>/.live/tm_<txid>-live` → `[{sender, at, body, from}]` (404 when no
   liveness is kept; skein docs/MESSAGES.md "Liveness (#138)"). With
   `validator`, it also emits `{event: "beacon", topic: "tm_<txid>-live",
   every, body: <empty>}`: the host's node publishes a signed beat every
   `every` ms — the frame carries the instance's identity key (`sender`), the
   gossip message its peer ID (`from`) — and amm-validator signs swaps and
   takes on new liquidity (signs an LP's addLiquidity, consents to an LP's
   pool deploy) for every registered token; without `validator` it refuses
   all three, `not_validating` (it reads the role in effect, the switch over
   `config.overlay.validator`, at each call). A deregister reverses both
   (`unliveness`, `unbeacon`). These are the only role settings: `config.amm.ammP2p.market`,
   `heartbeatSeconds` and `offlineSeconds` are gone (`validator.every` is the
   beat, `market.window` the offline threshold), and so are `validate` /
   `unvalidate` (the box `amm/validate`), the validated set and amm-p2p's
   start / stop; per-token permissioning is a later refinement ("if we
   needed that kind of split, we would split it across multiple skeins").

   **The validator named** (0.4.0): the Swap page reads each token's
   `.live` read, takes each beat's `sender` (the validator) and `from` (its
   peer ID), plans only over the pools whose validator beat within the window, and sends
   `amm.swap.submit` with that validator's `peerId` beside its `validator`
   key (`amm.pool.submit` and `amm.liquidity.submit` the same, from the
   Pools page). The relay looks at no liveness: it dials `peerId`, or, when
   `peerId` is its own node's, calls its own `amm-validator` in-VM with the
   same package, as the front door calls the route's handler for a frame.
5. **The pages** at `<base>/`, served from the app's own tree (`www/`):
   Tokens (the wallet's tokens), Pools (create a pool, add and remove
   liquidity), Swap, Validator (this instance as a validator: the registered
   tokens and the two settings, no buttons); the Mandala
   pages at `<base>/mandala/`. They call `<base>/lookup` (`ls_amm`,
   `ls_mandala`), `<base>/.live/tm_<txid>-live` (the runtime's liveness read),
   `<base>/call` (the relay) and `<base>/submit`. The pages are a read (a
   call, anyone, signed or not; 0.5.0); `/call` and `/submit` are message
   routes (a signed request). `<base>/live` is gone (0.5.0).

**Submit and look up** (BRC-22, synchronous: skein-overlay 0.9.1; by message instead, answered later to the submitter's box; BRC-24):

```
POST <base>/submit                     → 200, the STEAK (BRC-22; 503 + Retry-After while undecided)
X-Topics: ["tm_<txid>"]
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
<BEEF>

POST <base>/lookup
{"service": "ls_amm", "query": {"tokenId": "<txid>"}}
{"service": "ls_amm", "query": {"tokenId": "<txid>", "outpoint": "<txid>_0", "beef": true}}
{"service": "ls_amm", "query": {"tokenId": "<txid>", "validatorIdentityKey": "<hex>"}}
{"service": "ls_mandala", "query": {"tokenId": "<txid>"}}
{"service": "ls_mandala_deploys", "query": {"tokenId": "<txid>"}}
```
